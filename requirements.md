# Enterprise Agentic PaaS: Requirement Specification

This document outlines the core functional and non-functional requirements for building an enterprise-grade Agentic Platform. It covers the full capability spectrum: from no-code agent creation and durable single-agent execution, through governed skill composition, to coordinated multi-agent teams — all underpinned by enterprise security, operational excellence, and strict compliance.

## 1. Platform Vision and Goals

### Platform Vision

To provide a secure, highly-scalable, and developer-friendly Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that transforms how enterprises build and operate AI-driven automation. The platform operates on a **two-layered foundation** for complete domain-driven agentic solutions:

**Layer 1: Agent Infrastructure (Execution & Reasoning)**
Built on a four-tier capability hierarchy — Tools, Skills, Sub-Agents, and Agent Teams — that separates primitive execution from governed composition, and single-agent reasoning from coordinated multi-agent workflows.

At the base, platform engineers register primitive **Tools** (stateless, schema-typed API operations). Skill Developers compose Tools into reusable **Skills** with embedded SOPs and RBAC guardrails. Agent creators assemble Skills into **Sub-Agents** with defined personas and capability scopes. Finally, **Agent Teams** orchestrate multiple specialist sub-agents in parallel or sequential pipelines to tackle complex, multi-domain tasks — effectively deploying a self-assembling workforce on demand.

**Layer 2: Data & Context Infrastructure (Knowledge Graphs & Domain Ontologies)**
Domain-specific **Knowledge Graphs** (KGs) provide persistent, tenant-isolated data context for agents. Architects model domain structure (services, deployments, teams, assets, risks) using natural language via the **KG-Architect** system agent. KGs serve two critical functions:
- **Context Injection**: Agent reasoning loops automatically incorporate relevant KG subgraphs as structured context, grounding decisions in domain topology and relationships.
- **Semantic Reasoning**: Agents query KGs to understand blast radius, dependencies, and compliance constraints without external API calls — enabling faster incident response and informed decision-making.

**Domain Solution Templates: Cookbooks**
**Cookbooks** are pre-built, versioned domain solution templates that bundle agents, skills, KGs, and MCP integrations for specific verticals (DevOps, Fintech, Healthcare, etc.). A cookbook encapsulates:
- **Agent Manifests** (L1): Pre-configured sub-agents and teams for domain-specific workflows
- **Knowledge Graph Schema** (L2): Domain ontology (entities, relationships, properties) tailored to the vertical
- **Skill & Tool Bundles**: Curated, security-reviewed skills and tools for the domain
- **MCP Integrations**: Recommended MCP servers (e.g., PagerDuty, Stripe, Salesforce)
- **Configuration Variables**: Domain-specific settings for multi-tenant customization

Cookbooks accelerate time-to-deployment: domain architects select a cookbook, customize variables (API endpoints, credentials, thresholds), and within minutes deploy a fully-functional agentic solution for their business domain.

This two-layer architecture democratizes agent creation for no-code users while giving platform engineers deep, governed control over every primitive in the system. It ensures every AI action is auditable, every capability is versioned, and every cost is attributed — from a single tool call to a coordinated team execution executing within rich domain context.

### Strategic Goals

1. **Composable Agent Workforce:** Enable domain experts to deploy sophisticated AI workflows — spanning tool invocation, skill composition, and multi-agent collaboration — in hours rather than weeks, without writing code. Platform engineers control the governed primitives; no-code users assemble them.

2. **Domain-Driven Agentic Solutions via Cookbooks:** Accelerate vertical-specific deployments through pre-built, versioned cookbooks that bundle agents, knowledge graphs, skills, and MCP integrations. Architects select a cookbook for their domain (DevOps, Fintech, Healthcare), customize variables, and deploy a production-ready agentic system within minutes — shifting time-to-value from weeks of custom development to rapid configuration.

3. **Enterprise-Grade Resilience:** Guarantee zero-data-loss execution across all tiers. Durable ReAct loops survive pod crashes, API limits, and transient failures. Agent Teams tolerate sub-agent failures gracefully, resuming exactly where execution left off.

4. **Zero-Trust Security by Design:** Every tool invocation uses a short-lived, scoped machine identity. All inter-service communication runs over mTLS. Inbound webhooks require HMAC signature validation. Secrets rotate automatically. A living threat model governs every new capability added to the platform.

5. **Governed Extensibility Without Lock-in:** The four-tier model is provider-agnostic throughout. LLMs, memory stores, and tool backends are pluggable. Any engineer can contribute a new Tool, Skill, Sub-Agent, or Cookbook through a standardized registration and security-review workflow.

6. **Operational Accountability:** Every platform action is observable, costed, and governed. SLOs are defined at workflow, skill, and tool granularity. Cost is attributed per tenant, per agent, and per skill. Quota enforcement, incident runbooks, and SLO burn-rate alerts ensure the platform operates predictably at enterprise scale.

## 2. Core User Journeys

To contextualize the platform's requirements, the following journeys illustrate how different personas interact with the Agentic PaaS.

### Journey 1: The "No-Code" Agent Creation (Persona: Domain Expert / Product Manager)

* **Step 1:** A Domain Expert logs into **Agent Studio** using Enterprise SSO.

* **Step 2:** They create a new agent. The **Agent Creation Dialog** now includes an **AI-Powered Manifest Assistant** panel that helps them design the agent. They describe what the agent should do (e.g., "Handle customer support ticket routing and escalation").

* **Step 3:** The **Manifest Assistant** converses naturally with them, drafting a "System Prompt" and recommending pre-approved **Skills** from the **Skill Catalog** (e.g., `Email Sender Skill v1.0.0`, `Ticket Database Skill v2.1.0`). The assistant understands the catalog of available skills and tools via context injection, and can propose new skills if catalog gaps exist. With one click, they apply the assistant's recommendations directly to the form.

* **Step 4:** Using a visual dropdown, they attach the assistant-recommended (or manually selected) **Skills** from the **Skill Catalog**. The Studio enforces explicit version pinning — wildcards are disallowed in production manifests. Under the hood, each skill safely bundles primitive tools with InfoSec-approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

* **Step 5:** They open the **Agent Simulator** in the Studio to chat with the drafted agent. They watch the execution trace graph in real-time to ensure it utilizes its skills correctly.

* **Step 6:** Satisfied, they select a **Canary** rollout strategy and click "Deploy." The platform generates the YAML manifest, provisions Temporal workers, and initially routes 10% of traffic to the new version — automatically rolling back if the workflow success rate drops below baseline.

### Journey 2: Resilient Task Execution (Persona: End User & System)

* **Step 1:** An End User asks the deployed agent to "Analyze yesterday's traffic spike and correlate it with any code deployments."

* **Step 2:** The Agent enters its **Durable Execution Loop** (ReAct). It successfully utilizes a `Metrics Analysis Skill` and then begins executing a `GitHub Audit Skill`.

* **Step 3:** *System Failure:* The EKS node running the Temporal Worker suddenly crashes due to underlying hardware failure.

* **Step 4:** *Recovery:* A new worker spins up on a healthy node. Thanks to Temporal, it does not restart the task or re-query the metrics. It seamlessly resumes the exact step where it failed. If the agent was operating as part of an Agent Team, the orchestrator detects the sub-agent failure, retries it on the healthy worker, and the team execution continues without restarting the other sub-agents.

* **Step 5:** The Agent finishes the analysis and returns the final correlated report to the user.

### Journey 3: Human-In-The-Loop Approval (Persona: Senior Engineer / Approver)

* **Step 1:** An automated monitoring agent detects a memory leak and decides the best course of action is to restart the affected pods.

* **Step 2:** It invokes its `Kubernetes Remediation Skill`, which attempts to call the primitive `restart_k8s_pod` tool.

* **Step 3:** The platform's RBAC engine intercepts this, noting the underlying tool is marked as "mutating" and requires human approval. The workflow enters a suspended state.

* **Step 4:** An alert is sent to a dedicated Slack channel with a link to the Agent Studio.

* **Step 5:** A Senior Engineer clicks the link, views the **Execution Trace Visualizer** (an interactive DAG showing exactly which logs the agent read and why it decided a restart was necessary), and clicks "Approve."

* **Step 6:** The workflow wakes up, executes the sandbox tool, and resolves the incident.

### Journey 4: Event-Driven Agent Triggering (Persona: Automated System)

* **Step 1:** An external observability tool (e.g., Datadog, PagerDuty) detects a sudden spike in 5xx errors and fires a webhook carrying an HMAC-SHA256 signature and an `Idempotency-Key`. The API Gateway validates the signature and checks the idempotency key — duplicate events within 24 hours return the cached workflow ID without spawning a second execution.

* **Step 2:** The Agentic PaaS API Gateway receives the webhook and maps the payload to the specific "L1 Triage Agent" manifest.

* **Step 3:** The Temporal Workflow Engine spins up the agent asynchronously, passing the alert payload as the initial context prompt.

* **Step 4:** The agent autonomously uses its skills to pull recent logs and check Kubernetes events.

* **Step 5:** Without any human initiation, the agent compiles a summary, updates the PagerDuty ticket, and posts its root-cause hypothesis to the SRE Slack channel.

### Journey 5: Tool Registration & Skill Composition (Persona: Skill Developer)

* **Step 1:** A platform engineer writes a new tool spec — a JSON schema defining the tool's name, typed inputs/outputs, required auth level (`read` vs `mutating`), and sandboxing requirements — and opens a Pull Request against the Tool Registry.

* **Step 2:** The platform's security team reviews the spec for threat surface (prompt injection risk, lateral movement potential) and approves it. The tool's status transitions from `pending_review` to `approved` and becomes visible in the Skill Builder.

* **Step 3:** A Skill Developer opens the **Agent Studio Skill Builder**, selects the approved tool, attaches one or more companion tools, and writes the governing System Operating Procedure (SOP) prompt that constrains when and how the tool is invoked.

* **Step 4:** The Skill Developer sets the RBAC classification (e.g., `mutating: true`, `approval_required: true`) and publishes the skill as `v1.0.0`. The skill immediately appears in the Skill Catalog for No-Code users.

* **Step 5:** No-Code users attaching the new skill see its version, description, and required approval level in the Catalog. Agents in production must pin to an explicit version (e.g., `db-triage-skill@v1.0.0`).

### Journey 6: Agent Team Handles a Multi-Domain Incident (Persona: SRE / Orchestrator)

* **Step 1:** A PagerDuty webhook fires an alert payload for a P1 production incident. The API Gateway validates the HMAC signature and checks the `Idempotency-Key` — the event is new, so the "Full-Stack Triage Team" manifest is invoked asynchronously.

* **Step 2:** The **Orchestrator Agent** (Tier 3 sub-agent acting as team lead) receives the alert payload, parses the affected services, and decomposes the investigation: it dispatches `DB Triage Sub-Agent` and `K8s Inspector Sub-Agent` **in parallel** via the Sub-Agent Registry.

* **Step 3:** Both sub-agents execute concurrently within their own durable Temporal workflows. The DB agent finds a slow query saturating the connection pool; the K8s agent finds an OOM-killed pod on the same node.

* **Step 4:** Both sub-agents return typed results to the Orchestrator. It synthesizes the findings, correlates the two root causes, and invokes the `Incident Report Skill` to generate a structured summary. The summary is posted to the SRE Slack channel.

* **Step 5:** The Orchestrator determines the K8s pod must be restarted. It invokes the `K8s Remediation Skill`, which triggers **HITL** because `restart_k8s_pod` is marked `mutating`. The entire team workflow suspends.

* **Step 6:** A Senior Engineer receives the alert, reviews the Execution Trace Visualizer (showing the parallel DB and K8s investigation lanes and the Orchestrator's synthesis), and clicks **Approve (MFA)**. The team resumes, the pod is restarted, and the Orchestrator closes the PagerDuty incident.

### Journey 7: External Tool Integration via MCP (Persona: Agent Creator / SRE)

* **Step 1:** An Agent Creator wants to extend their agent with external capabilities (e.g., GitHub code search, filesystem access, external data sources). Instead of asking platform engineers to register new tools, they register an external MCP server endpoint (`https://github-mcp.example.com:3000`) via the Agent Studio settings.

* **Step 2:** The MCP server is registered in the **MCP Registry** service per tenant. The platform automatically discovers the server's tools and caches them to avoid repeated discovery overhead.

* **Step 3:** The Agent Creator adds the MCP server ID to the agent manifest under `mcp_servers: ["github-mcp-server"]`. No new platform deployment is needed; the capability is available immediately.

* **Step 4:** When the agent executes, it queries the MCP Registry to discover tools (via `discover_mcp_tools` activity), augmenting the agent's tool context with externally-provided tools (named `mcp__github_mcp_server__search_code`, etc.).

* **Step 5:** The agent invokes an external tool (e.g., "Search for XSS vulnerabilities in recent commits"). The ReAct loop routes the `mcp__*` tool call through the MCP Registry, which calls the external MCP server and returns the result.

* **Step 6:** The SRE also wants to give external partners access to internal platform skills. They issue an MCP server token via the Admin Console, share the token and the platform's MCP endpoint with external partners. Claude Desktop and other MCP clients can now discover and invoke platform skills using the token.

### Journey 8: Domain Architect Builds DevOps Knowledge Graph (Persona: Domain Architect / SRE Lead)

* **Step 1:** A Domain Architect opens Agent Studio and launches the **KG-Architect** system agent chat interface to model their infrastructure.

* **Step 2:** They describe their domain structure naturally: "We have a microservices architecture with 12 services. Each service has deployments in dev, staging, and prod environments. Some services depend on shared databases. We have runbooks for common incidents."

* **Step 3:** The **KG-Architect** agent parses the requirements and creates the domain model step-by-step:
  - Calls `kg-create-graph` with entity types: Service, Deployment, Environment, Runbook, Database
  - Calls `kg-add-node` for each service (12 nodes)
  - Calls `kg-add-node` for each environment (3 nodes)
  - Calls `kg-add-edge` to express "Service deployed_in Environment" relationships

* **Step 4:** The Architect reviews the generated graph in Agent Studio and refines it: "Add that api-gateway depends_on both user-service and product-service."

* **Step 5:** KG-Architect calls `kg-add-edge` twice to establish the `depends_on` relationships. The graph now captures 15 nodes and 20+ edges of domain topology.

* **Step 6:** The graph is persisted and ready for use by all agents in the tenant. Agents can now call `kg-query` and `kg-search` to understand infrastructure topology during incident response.

### Journey 9: SRE Agent Queries KG for Blast Radius (Persona: SRE / Incident Responder)

* **Step 1:** A PagerDuty alert fires: "api-gateway is returning 5xx errors." The alert triggers the "SRE Incident Triage Agent."

* **Step 2:** The SRE Agent begins reasoning and calls the `kg-query` tool: "Query graph ID=devops-infra, start_node=api-gateway, depth=2"

* **Step 3:** The KG Service traverses the graph and returns:
  - Direct dependents: user-service, product-service
  - Downstream impact: order-service (depends on product-service)
  - Shared resources: postgres-cluster (used by product-service and order-service)

* **Step 4:** The Agent simultaneously calls the PagerDuty MCP tool to fetch active alerts across the returned services.

* **Step 5:** By combining KG context (topology) and live MCP data (alerts), the agent synthesizes: "api-gateway failure is cascading to product-service and order-service. product-service has 2 active P1 alerts and shares postgres-cluster. Likely root cause: postgres connection pool saturation. Recommend checking product-service runbook."

* **Step 6:** The agent posts a structured analysis to the SRE Slack channel with KG-derived relationships and recommended runbook references.

### Journey 10: Multi-Tenant KG Isolation & Domain-Specific Ontologies (Persona: Platform Operator / Multi-Tenant Admin)

* **Step 1:** Two separate customers onboard to the platform:
  - **Customer A (DevOps/SRE)**: Creates a DevOps KG with entity types: Service, Deployment, Environment, Team, Runbook
  - **Customer B (Fintech)**: Creates a Fintech KG with entity types: Portfolio, Asset, Risk, Counterparty, Trade

* **Step 2:** PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces strict tenant isolation. Customer A's KG queries only return their 20 nodes/40 edges. Customer B's queries only return their 100 nodes/300 edges. Cross-tenant query attempts return empty results (RLS filters at DB layer).

* **Step 3:** An SRE Agent in Customer A's tenant calls `kg-search` to find "services with SLA <99%". The search uses pgvector semantic similarity on node properties stored in Customer A's isolated KG only.

* **Step 4:** A Risk Agent in Customer B's tenant calls `kg-query` to find "assets exposed to EUR/USD volatility > 5%". Its queries never see Customer A's infrastructure KG — complete data partition.

* **Step 5:** The platform operator (Admin Console, not subject to RLS) can view aggregate KG statistics across all tenants: "10 tenants, 500 total graphs, avg 25 nodes per graph." But standard user queries cannot cross this boundary.

* **Step 6:** Both customers independently refine their domain models using KG-Architect, creating specialized ontologies for their business domains. The shared platform infrastructure ensures isolation, scalability, and consistency.

### Journey 11: Hybrid Workflow with Cron Trigger, HITL, and Cost Tracking (Persona: Fintech Operations / Architect)

* **Step 1:** A Fintech Operations team needs a daily settlement reconciliation workflow. They define it in YAML and register it via Agent Studio → Workflows → New Workflow.

* **Step 2:** The workflow definition specifies:
  - **Trigger**: Cron schedule "0 17 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 5pm)
  - **Steps**:
    1. Fetch trades from NSE (task: invoke_skill "fetch-nse-trades")
    2. Analyze settlement risk (agent: run_agent "settlement-risk-agent")
    3. If risk detected, seek approval (hitl: "High-risk settlement. Approve?")
    4. File regulatory report (task: invoke_skill "file-regulatory-report")

* **Step 3:** Platform validates the YAML, registers the workflow, and creates a Temporal Schedule for the cron expression. The workflow is now in `active` status.

* **Step 4:** At 5pm on the next business day, Temporal automatically triggers the workflow via the schedule. The workflow runs on the `platform-hybrid-queue` (managed worker).

* **Step 5:** Step 1 (fetch trades) executes successfully, returning 500 trades. Step 2 (agent) runs the settlement-risk-agent, which consumes 2,000 input tokens and 1,500 output tokens (cost attributed to the workflow run).

* **Step 6:** Step 2 output indicates high risk. The workflow branches to Step 3 (HITL gate). The workflow enters `paused_awaiting_approval` state. An alert is sent to the Approver Slack channel with a link to Agent Studio.

* **Step 7:** A Senior Analyst opens Agent Studio → Workflow Runs → [workflow-run-id] and reviews the execution trace:
  - Step 1: Completed (500 trades fetched, 150ms duration)
  - Step 2: Completed (Risk detected: 45 high-value trades, 12s duration, $0.15 cost)
  - Step 3: Awaiting Approval (shows the HITL prompt and context)

* **Step 8:** The Analyst clicks "Approve" (with MFA). The workflow resumes at Step 3.

* **Step 4:** Step 4 (file-regulatory-report) executes successfully, filing the report to the regulatory body.

* **Step 9:** The workflow completes. The run is marked `completed` in the database. Cost aggregation:
  - Step 1: $0.01 (task execution)
  - Step 2: $0.15 (agent reasoning + tokens)
  - Step 3: $0.00 (HITL gate, human approval)
  - Step 4: $0.02 (task execution)
  - **Total**: $0.18

* **Step 10:** The following day, the Fintech team views the cost dashboard in Admin Console and sees: "settlement-workflow: $0.18 cost over 5 runs this week" with a drill-down showing per-run and per-step breakdowns.

* **Step 11:** (Future iteration) The team creates a second workflow variant for a different settlement venue. Both workflows run independently on their own schedules, with isolated cost tracking per workflow. Multi-tenancy ensures no cost or data leakage to other customers.

## 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

These requirements define the core capabilities of the platform, prioritized for an MVP to Production roadmap.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR1** | **P0** | **Agent Studio & Manifest Builder** | Provide an Agent Studio with five builder surfaces: Agent Builder (persona, skills, memory constraints, YAML export), Tool Registry UI (register and review tool specs), Skill Builder (compose tools + SOPs, publish versioned skills), Sub-Agent Registry (define capability contracts), and Team Manifest Editor (wire sub-agents with coordination strategy). Includes an AI-powered Manifest Assistant to guide no-code users through agent design. |
| **FR1a** | **P0** | **AI-Assisted Manifest Design (Manifest Assistant)** | Embed a conversational AI assistant within the Agent Creation UI. The assistant helps no-code users design agent manifests by: (1) drafting system prompts based on user description; (2) recommending appropriate skills from the active catalog; (3) proposing new skill/tool definitions when catalog gaps exist. The assistant has access to the live catalog of skills and tools (injected as context). Responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE), and users can apply suggestions directly to the form with one click. The assistant is itself a platform agent (reserved `tenant_id: "platform-system"`, running on a dedicated task queue) powered by a capable LLM. |
| **FR2** | **P0** | **Durable Execution Loop** | Agents and Agent Teams must execute within a resilient Temporal-backed loop. System failures, pod crashes, and API rate limits must not lose state — execution resumes exactly at the last committed step. Sub-agent failures within a team are retried independently; the team does not restart from the beginning. |
| **FR3** | **P0** | **Dynamic Tool Registry** | Support tool registration via MCP discovery or manual PR-based spec submission (typed JSON schema: inputs, outputs, auth level, sandboxing requirement). All tools require a security review approval gate before catalog availability. Tools are semantically versioned; breaking changes require a new major version. |
| **FR4** | **P0** | **Skill Catalog** | Senior Engineers compose approved Tools with System Operating Procedures (SOPs) into versioned, governed Skills. Skills use semver; production agent manifests must pin explicit versions. Deprecated skills display automated impact analysis (which agents are affected) and a migration path in Agent Studio. |
| **FR5** | **P1** | **Agent Simulator & Testing** | Agent Studio includes a Sandbox Simulator for both single agents and Agent Teams. In team mode, the telemetry panel shows sub-agent dispatch events (`[DISPATCH] → Sub-Agent`, `[RESULT] ← Sub-Agent`) and per-agent swimlanes in the live trace. Creators validate behavior before deploying to production. |
| **FR6** | **P1** | **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | When any agent or team member invokes a tool marked `mutating`, the entire workflow (including any running parallel sub-agents) enters a suspended state. An approval request is sent to the designated HITL Approver with full execution context. The workflow resumes only after MFA-backed approval or is terminated on rejection. |
| **FR7** | **P1** | **Universal Memory Access** | The platform manages short-term context windows (Redis) and long-term semantic memory (Vector DB via pgvector) automatically. Agent Teams share a configurable memory scope — members can read team-shared memories or operate in isolated per-agent memory partitions, configured in the Team Manifest. |
| **FR8** | **P1** | **Event-Driven Triggers** | The platform exposes webhook endpoints and event bus consumers (e.g., Kafka) for external systems to trigger agents or Agent Teams. Inbound webhooks require HMAC-SHA256 signature validation (`X-Signature` header) and an `Idempotency-Key`. Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff (up to 6 attempts) before routing to a dead-letter queue retained for 30 days. |
| **FR9** | **P1** | **Sub-Agent Invocation & Handoff** | Parent agents and orchestrators can invoke registered sub-agents sequentially (blocking) or in parallel (fan-out). Sub-agents return typed results against their declared capability contract. The platform enforces contract compliance at invocation time — out-of-scope skill usage is rejected and logged. |
| **FR10** | **P1** | **Execution Trace Visualizer** | Interactive DAG within Agent Studio showing reasoning steps, skill invocations, and Temporal history. In Agent Team mode, the DAG renders parallel sub-agent swimlanes with handoff edges, a unified timeline, and per-node cost and latency annotations. HITL-blocked nodes are highlighted for Approver action. |
| **FR11** | **P0** | **Enterprise SSO Integration** | Agent Studio supports Single Sign-On via SAML 2.0 or OIDC (e.g., Okta, Entra ID). Role assignments (Platform Admin, Skill Developer, Agent Creator, Sub-Agent Developer, HITL Approver) are sourced from the IdP via group claims at login time. |
| **FR12** | **P0** | **Granular RBAC & Personas** | The platform enforces Role-Based Access Control across all four tiers. Roles: Platform Admin (full access), Skill Developer (register tools, author skills), Sub-Agent Developer (define sub-agents and teams), Agent Creator (no-code agent and team assembly), and HITL Approver (approve/reject mutating actions). Each role is scoped to a tenant. |
| **FR13** | **P0** | **Sub-Agent Registry** | Platform provides a Sub-Agent Registry where Sub-Agent Developers define and version specialized sub-agents. Each entry specifies: `persona`, `allowed_skills` (version-pinned), `model`, `max_iterations`, and an invocation contract (typed input/output schema). Registered sub-agents are available to Team Manifests and parent agent reasoning loops. |
| **FR14** | **P1** | **Agent Team Orchestration** | Platform supports declarative Team Manifests specifying member sub-agents, coordination strategy (parallel fan-out, sequential chain, or conditional branching on sub-agent output), and shared memory scope. The orchestrator agent decomposes the goal, dispatches sub-agents, synthesizes results, and produces a unified response. Teams are simulated in the Agent Simulator before deployment. |
| **FR15** | **P1** | **Skill Command Interface & Hooks** | Skills are invocable via slash-command syntax (e.g., `/db-triage --target=prod-rds-01 --window=1h`) from the Agent Studio chat interface and the REST API. Arguments are validated against the skill's input schema before dispatch. The platform supports declarative pre/post-skill hooks (YAML-configured) for audit logging, cost metering, and HITL interception — without modifying skill logic. |
| **FR16** | **P1** | **Capability Lifecycle Management** | All four tiers follow a formal state machine: `Draft → Staged → Active ↔ Paused → Archived`. State transitions are immutably logged. Deployment supports three strategies: All-at-once, Blue-Green, and Canary (10% → 25% → 100% with configurable ramp). Auto-rollback triggers if workflow success rate drops more than 10% from the prior version's baseline over 10 minutes. |
| **FR17** | **P1** | **Cost & Quota Dashboard** | Real-time cost attribution at tenant, agent, and skill granularity: LLM inference tokens, sandbox execution time, and Vector DB operations. Budget alerts fire at 80% and 100% of the monthly allocation. Soft quota limits queue requests (returning `Retry-After`); hard limits reject with `429 QuotaExceeded`. Quota thresholds are configurable per tenant via Agent Studio settings. |
| **FR18** | **P1** | **MCP Client Support** | Platform SHALL support connecting to external MCP servers (HTTP + SSE transport) per tenant. Agents can reference MCP server IDs in their manifest; at runtime, tools from those servers are discovered and injected into the agent's tool context. Tool discovery is cached to avoid redundant network calls. MCP tool invocation is routed through the MCP registry service via standard Temporal activities. ✅ **Implemented** |
| **FR19** | **P1** | **MCP Server Support** | Platform SHALL expose its registered skills as an MCP server endpoint (HTTP + SSE). External MCP-compatible clients (e.g., Claude Desktop) can authenticate with a hashed bearer token (scoped to a tenant), discover the platform's skills, and invoke them. MCP server support enables Agentic workflows outside the platform to access platform capabilities. ✅ **Implemented**: Global MCP server registration, token management, and Admin Console UI for `/mcp-servers` |
| **FR20** | **P0** | **System Tools Management** | Admin Console provides platform-wide tool registry management accessible via `/system-tools`. Admins can register new tools, review tool specifications, approve for catalog availability, and manage versioning. All tools require security review approval before becoming available to agents. ✅ **Implemented** |
| **FR21** | **P0** | **System Skills Management** | Admin Console provides platform-wide skill catalog management accessible via `/system-skills`. Admins can create, edit, and lifecycle-manage skills (draft → staged → active). Skills bundle tools with SOPs and are available for agent composition. Version pinning is enforced for production deployments. ✅ **Implemented** |
| **FR22** | **P0** | **System Agents Management** | Admin Console provides platform system agent management via `/system-agents`. Admins can view, edit, and deploy platform system agents (e.g., Manifest Assistant, monitoring agents). Lifecycle transitions are logged and enable canary rollout strategies. ✅ **Implemented** |
| **FR23** | **P1** | **Knowledge Graph Foundation** | Platform provides a persistent, tenant-isolated Knowledge Graph (KG) service backed by PostgreSQL with pgvector semantic search. KGs store domain structure: graphs (collections), nodes (typed entities), and edges (relationships with properties). Multi-tenant isolation enforced via PostgreSQL RLS policies on `tenant_id`. Agents can query KGs for structural context without external API calls. ✅ **Implemented (Phase 1)** |
| **FR24** | **P1** | **KG System Tools** | Platform exposes five system tools for agent-callable KG operations: (1) `kg-create-graph` — Create domain KG; (2) `kg-add-node` — Add typed entities; (3) `kg-add-edge` — Add relationships; (4) `kg-query` — Traverse with depth limits; (5) `kg-search` — Semantic search on properties via pgvector. All tools route through Skill Dispatcher and are available to all agents for ontology queries. ✅ **Implemented (Phase 3)** |
| **FR25** | **P1** | **KG-Architect System Agent** | Platform includes a specialized system agent (`kg-architect`) for natural-language knowledge graph construction. Domain architects describe structure conversationally; the agent parses requirements, calls kg-* tools, and iteratively builds the ontology. Simplifies KG creation for non-technical users. Runs on isolated `platform-system-agent-queue`. ✅ **Implemented (Phase 3)** |
| **FR26** | **P1** | **Knowledge Graph Workspace (Agent Studio)** | Agent Studio provides a dedicated "Knowledge Graphs" workspace (port 3000) for domain architects to design, build, visualize, and manage tenant knowledge graphs. The workspace includes: (1) **KG List** — browse all tenant KGs, create new graphs, delete/archive; (2) **KG Builder** — natural-language chat interface with KG-Architect system agent, real-time graph preview, iteration history, undo/redo; (3) **KG Visualizer** — interactive graph canvas with search/filter, node inspection, relationship traversal, statistics, and export (JSON/PNG); (4) **Multi-KG Support** — architects manage multiple domain KGs (one per vertical: DevOps, Fintech, Healthcare). Multi-tenant isolation enforced via RLS at KG Service layer. |
| **FR27** | **P2** | **Knowledge Graph Management UI (Admin Console)** | Admin Console provides `/knowledge-graphs` page for cross-tenant KG administration: list all tenant KGs, view aggregate KG statistics, inspect specific tenant graphs (read-only), search entities across tenants, view relationship patterns. For operators to understand platform KG usage; architects use Agent Studio workspace instead. |
| **FR28** | **P1** | **KG-Architect System Agent Integration** | KG-Architect system agent is embedded in Agent Studio KG Builder as a conversational interface. Agent runs on isolated `platform-system-agent-queue`. Architects describe domain structure in natural language; agent iteratively calls kg-* tools (kg-create-graph, kg-add-node, kg-add-edge, kg-query) to build ontology. Agent provides: (1) Structured steps shown in iteration history, (2) Real-time graph preview as changes are made, (3) Confirmation prompts before destructive operations, (4) Ability to refine with follow-up instructions, (5) Export of generated KG for documentation. Streaming responses via SSE for real-time chat interaction. |
| **FR29** | **P0** | **Hybrid Workflow Authoring (YAML)** | Platform supports declarative workflow definition via YAML. Workflows specify: `id`, `version`, `trigger` (manual/webhook/cron/event), `steps` (task/agent/hitl/branch/parallel/wait). Steps support: `depends_on` for DAG sequencing, `input_mapping` with {{ }} template variables, `condition` for branching, `timeout` for step-level SLOs. YAML is validated at registration time; invalid workflows are rejected with structured error messages. Workflows can be deployed via API or Agent Studio UI. |
| **FR30** | **P0** | **Hybrid Workflow Execution (HybridWorkflow Class)** | Platform provides `HybridWorkflow` Temporal workflow class that executes declarative YAML workflow definitions. Execution model: load workflow definition, topologically sort steps, execute each step (task/agent/hitl/branch/parallel/wait), collect results, handle failures. Step results stored in `workflow_runs.step_results` as JSON. Failed steps are recorded with error messages; on-failure action (abort/retry/continue) determines workflow continuation. All execution is backed by Temporal for durability. |
| **FR31** | **P0** | **Expression Evaluator & {{ }} Templates** | Platform provides deterministic expression evaluator for workflow templates. Syntax: `{{ variable }}` for substitution (e.g., `{{ inputs.date }}`), `{{ condition }}` for branching. Supports: dot-path resolution (inputs.X, steps.Y.output.Z), string/number/boolean/null values, operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, AND, OR). Expressions pre-validated at workflow registration; no runtime code execution. Invalid expressions fail with structured errors. |
| **FR32** | **P0** | **Four Trigger Mechanisms** | Platform supports four orthogonal trigger types: (1) **Manual** — `POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/trigger`; (2) **Webhook** — HTTP POST to `/webhook/{id}` with HMAC-SHA256 validation; (3) **Cron** — Temporal Schedule based on cron expression (e.g., "0 17 * * 1-5"); (4) **Event-Driven** — Trigger multiple workflows from single event via event ID matching and fan-out. Each trigger type enforces multi-tenant isolation. |
| **FR33** | **P0** | **Webhook Trigger with HMAC Validation** | Webhook triggers validate HMAC-SHA256 signature computed over request body with tenant-specific secret. Headers: `X-Signature`, `X-Timestamp` (5-minute replay window), `Idempotency-Key` (24-hour deduplication). Valid webhooks are dispatched to the appropriate task queue; invalid signatures return 401 Unauthorized. Duplicate events within the idempotency window return cached workflow response. |
| **FR34** | **P0** | **Cron Schedule Trigger** | Cron-triggered workflows use Temporal Schedules for reliable scheduling. Cron expression is validated at workflow registration (CRON format: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`). Schedules handle missed intervals (at most one catch-up execution per missed period). Schedule state is persisted in Temporal server; no loss on restarts. Architects can pause/resume schedules via API. |
| **FR35** | **P0** | **Event-Driven Trigger (Fan-Out Pattern)** | Event-triggered workflows support fan-out: a single event can trigger multiple registered workflows. Platform matches event ID (provided by caller) to registered workflows using event filters. Each workflow execution is isolated; failures in one don't cascade. Event deduplication via event ID ensures idempotency (same event_id within 24h returns cached results). |
| **FR36** | **P0** | **Workflow Service API** | Platform provides RESTful workflow management API on port 8094: **Workflow Registry** — POST/GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/v1/workflows`; **Trigger** — POST `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/trigger`; **Runs** — GET `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/runs`, GET `/api/v1/workflow-runs/{run_id}`; **Events** — GET `/api/v1/workflow-runs/{run_id}/events` (proxies Temporal events); **Management** — POST `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/transition` (pause/resume). All endpoints enforce X-Tenant-ID header for multi-tenancy. |
| **FR37** | **P1** | **Workflow Step Types** | Hybrid workflows support six step types: (1) **task** — Execute registered skill; (2) **agent** — Run AI agent as child workflow; (3) **hitl** — Pause for human approval; (4) **branch** — Conditional step with true/false branches; (5) **parallel** — Fan-out multiple steps, join on completion; (6) **wait** — Pause until external event arrives or timeout. Each step type has typed inputs/outputs and retry semantics. |
| **FR38** | **P1** | **Workflow Orchestration Features** | Workflows support: **DAG Execution** — steps can declare `depends_on` for partial ordering; **Conditional Branching** — `branch` step with {{ }} condition; **Parallel Execution** — `parallel` step type fan-outs N sub-steps; **Error Handling** — per-step `on_failure` action (abort/retry/continue); **Timeouts** — per-step and workflow-level SLOs; **Composition** — steps can invoke agents or child workflows. |
| **FR39** | **P1** | **HITL Gate in Workflows** | Workflow `hitl` step pauses execution pending human approval. Approver receives: step ID, prompt, context (structured data for review). Approval timeout (configurable, default 1h) results in auto-denial if not acted. Approval decision is persisted to `hitl_approvals` table with approver identity, timestamp, and reasoning. Workflow resumes exactly at the HITL step after approval. |
| **FR40** | **P1** | **Python SDK (a1-agent-sdk)** | Platform exposes Python SDK for developers writing Temporal workflows. SDK provides 8 re-exported platform activities: `invoke_skill`, `invoke_tool`, `invoke_mcp_tool`, `run_agent`, `hitl_approval`, `kg_search`, `kg_query`, `notify`. Developers import from `a1_agent_sdk` and register via `get_platform_activities()` helper. SDK activities enforce multi-tenancy via `tenant_id` parameter; all activities are Temporal-compatible with typed inputs/outputs. ✅ **Implemented (Phase A)** |
| **FR41** | **P1** | **Workflow Cost Attribution** | Every workflow step (task/agent/hitl) has associated costs: LLM tokens (if agent step), MCP server calls, task execution time. Costs are aggregated per step, per workflow run, per agent (for agent steps), and per tenant. Cost data stored in TimescaleDB (`cost_events` table) with: `tenant_id`, `workflow_id`, `run_id`, `step_id`, `cost_usd`, `tokens`, `timestamp`. Costs visible in workflow detail UI and queryable via Admin API. |
| **FR42** | **P1** | **Workflow History & Run Tracking** | Platform tracks all workflow runs with state: `pending` → `running` → `completed|failed`. Runs stored in `workflow_runs` table with: `run_id`, `workflow_id`, `tenant_id`, `status`, `step_results` (JSON), `inputs`, `output`, `error`, `started_at`, `completed_at`. Run state is synced from Temporal + persisted to DB. Architects can view run history, step-by-step results, and error details in Agent Studio. |
| **FR43** | **P1** | **Workflow Execution Trace UI** | Agent Studio includes workflow execution trace visualizer showing DAG of steps, per-step execution time, status badges (completed/failed/pending), step outputs as JSON, and error messages. Trace can be exported for audit. For parallel steps, shows swimlanes with fork/join edges. Clicking a failed step shows error context. HITL steps highlight approver action required. |
| **FR44** | **P1** | **Developer Workflow Registration** | Developers can register custom Python Temporal workflows (written with `@workflow.defn`) via workflow-service API or Agent Studio. Registration specifies: workflow class name, task queue, input schema, description. Platform can then trigger registered workflows via REST API or webhook, even if code runs on developer-owned workers. Developer benefits from platform audit, cost tracking, and multi-tenancy features. |
| **FR45** | **P1** | **Workflow Versioning & Lifecycle** | Workflows support versioning (semver): registration creates a new version or updates existing. Workflow state machine: `draft` → `active` → `paused` → `archived`. Version history is tracked; architects can view past versions and rollback if needed. Active version is the only one triggered; all runs reference their triggering version for reproducibility. |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

These requirements dictate the operational, security, and resiliency standards (The "SRE" Layer).

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **NFR1** | **P0** | **Execution Sandboxing** | Tool execution involving arbitrary code or unknown inputs must run in ephemeral, isolated Docker containers. Containers prevent network lateral movement and are destroyed immediately after execution. Sandboxing applies to all four tiers — a skill invoking a tool always goes through the sandbox boundary. |
| **NFR2** | **P0** | **Immutable Auditability** | Every LLM prompt, skill decision, tool invocation, and sub-agent dispatch must be recorded via OpenTelemetry and stored in an immutable ledger. Agent Team traces must render as a unified DAG with per-sub-agent swimlanes; every span includes: skill invoked, tokens consumed, latency, and outcome. Ledger must support SRE replay and compliance export. |
| **NFR3** | **P0** | **Fault Tolerance** | The orchestration layer must survive pod crashes, node terminations, and API rate limits without losing session state. Within an Agent Team, sub-agent failures must be retried independently (up to the configured retry limit) — a single sub-agent failure must not terminate the full team. The orchestrator surfaces a partial result if a sub-agent exhausts retries. |
| **NFR4** | **P1** | **High Concurrency** | The platform must support thousands of simultaneous agent and team workflows via asynchronous, non-blocking Temporal workers on Kubernetes. Worker replicas scale horizontally based on Temporal task-queue depth. Agent Teams with parallel sub-agents must not serialize execution — each sub-agent occupies an independent worker. |
| **NFR5** | **P1** | **Model Agnosticism** | The LLM provider is pluggable across the platform (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, local vLLM/Ollama). Model selection is configurable per-sub-agent — members of the same Agent Team can run different models. Provider switching must not require manifest changes beyond updating the `model` field. |
| **NFR6** | **P1** | **Cost & Token Governance** | Cost governance operates at tenant, agent, skill, and tool-call granularity (LLM tokens + sandbox execution time + Vector DB ops). Soft quota limits queue excess requests and return a `Retry-After` header. Hard limits terminate the workflow with `429 QuotaExceeded`. Infinite ReAct loops are automatically terminated at a configurable `max_iterations` ceiling (default 10 per sub-agent). |
| **NFR7** | **P0** | **Agent Machine Identities** | Every agent, sub-agent, and team member operates using a short-lived, scoped OIDC token (5-minute TTL) issued by an internal STS service. Tokens contain the agent ID, permitted skill list, and resource constraints. Static or shared API keys are disallowed. The Tool Router validates token scope before any tool execution; out-of-scope invocations are rejected and logged. |
| **NFR8** | **P0** | **Zero-Trust Networking** | All inter-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with certificates rotated every 30 days. Kubernetes NetworkPolicy restricts Agent Worker pod egress exclusively to the LLM Gateway and Temporal cluster — no direct internet access. Service-to-service calls are authenticated via short-lived OIDC tokens in addition to mTLS. |
| **NFR9** | **P0** | **Webhook Security** | All inbound webhook events must include an HMAC-SHA256 signature (`X-Signature` header) computed over the request body with a tenant-specific secret. Requests missing a valid signature or carrying an `X-Timestamp` older than 5 minutes are rejected (replay prevention). An `Idempotency-Key` is required; duplicate events within 24 hours return the cached workflow response. |
| **NFR10** | **P0** | **Secret Lifecycle Management** | LLM API keys, OIDC signing keys, and database credentials rotate automatically on configurable intervals (default 90 days). A leak-detection service continuously scans execution logs and audit trails for credential exposure. Detected leaks trigger automatic revocation and an on-call alert within 5 minutes. |
| **NFR11** | **P1** | **Multi-Tenancy Isolation** | All platform resources — agent manifests, tool registrations, skill definitions, sub-agent contracts, team manifests, execution traces, and vector memories — are strictly isolated per tenant via separate PostgreSQL schemas and row-level security. A runaway workflow or quota breach in one tenant cannot consume resources allocated to another tenant. |
| **NFR12** | **P1** | **SLA & Availability** | The platform targets 99.95% availability for the API Gateway and Agent Studio. Performance SLOs: p99 workflow invocation latency ≤ 2s; p95 tool execution latency ≤ 5s. Disaster recovery targets: RTO ≤ 1 hour, RPO ≤ 15 minutes. Sustained SLO breaches trigger automated escalation and disable non-critical background processing. |
| **NFR13** | **P1** | **Session & Memory Lifecycle** | Sessions carry a configurable hard timeout (default 24h) and idle timeout (default 1h). Each session enforces a memory budget (default 512MB): purge policy activates at 80% utilization; workflow terminates with a structured `OutOfMemory` error at 100%. Vector embeddings are retained for a configurable duration per tenant (default 90 days) and then archived to cold storage. |
| **NFR14** | **P1** | **Hybrid Workflow Execution Latency** | Workflow trigger-to-start latency: p99 ≤ 1s for manual triggers, p99 ≤ 5s for webhook-based triggers (HMAC validation overhead). Step execution latency (including task + agent steps): p95 ≤ 10s. HITL approval gate must not block other workflows; approval can occur asynchronously with timeout constraints. |
| **NFR15** | **P0** | **Workflow Multi-Tenancy & RLS** | All workflow data (registrations, runs, step results, costs) are tenant-isolated via PostgreSQL RLS policies on `tenant_id` column. Cross-tenant queries return empty results at database layer. Tenants cannot enumerate, trigger, or inspect workflows from other tenants. Cost tracking is per-tenant; one tenant's workflow spending cannot affect another tenant's quota. |
| **NFR16** | **P1** | **Expression Evaluator Safety** | The expression evaluator supports only deterministic operations: dot-path resolution, string/number/boolean comparisons, and basic operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, AND, OR). No code execution, loops, or state mutation allowed. Invalid expressions fail gracefully with structured error messages. All expressions are pre-validated at workflow registration time. |
| **NFR17** | **P1** | **HITL Approval Durability** | HITL approvals are persisted to PostgreSQL `hitl_approvals` table (not in-memory). Workflow execution can resume after service restarts. Approval decisions include: approver identity, timestamp, audit trail, and reasoning. Approval timeout (configurable, default 1 hour) auto-denies if not acted upon; workflow records the timeout as a structured denial reason. |
| **NFR18** | **P1** | **Cron Trigger Reliability** | Cron-triggered workflows use Temporal Schedules for reliable scheduling. Missed schedules due to service downtime are caught up (at most one catch-up execution per missed interval). Cron expressions are validated at workflow registration; invalid expressions are rejected with clear error messages. Schedule state is persisted in Temporal server; no loss of scheduling state on restarts. |
| **NFR19** | **P1** | **Event-Driven Fan-Out Scalability** | Event-triggered workflows support fan-out to multiple registered workflows with tenant isolation per execution. Fan-out dispatch latency (N workflows): p95 ≤ 100ms + workflow trigger latency. Event deduplic ation via event ID ensures idempotency (same event_id within 24h returns cached results). Fan-out failures in one workflow don't propagate to others. |
| **NFR20** | **P0** | **Cost Tracking for Hybrid Workflows** | Every workflow step (task, agent, hitl) has associated cost attributes: LLM tokens (if step runs agent), task execution time, MCP server calls. Costs are aggregated per step, per workflow run, and per tenant. Cost data is persisted in TimescaleDB for historical queries, reporting, and quota enforcement. Per-step cost is available in workflow_runs.step_results for granular analysis. |

## 5. Platform SDK (a1-agent-sdk) Capabilities

The **a1-agent-sdk** is a Python package that exposes platform primitives as Temporal activities, enabling developers to write hybrid workflows that leverage platform capabilities without reimplementing them.

### SDK Activities Reference

Each activity is a Temporal-compatible async function with typed inputs/outputs, configurable timeouts, and retry semantics. All activities enforce multi-tenant isolation via `tenant_id` parameter.

#### 1. invoke_skill(skill_name: str, args: dict, tenant_id: str, timeout_seconds: int = 300) → dict

**Purpose**: Execute a registered platform skill.

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "skill_name": "string (required)",
  "args": {"type": "object"},
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "timeout_seconds": "integer (default 300)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "output": {"type": "object"},
  "error": "string (if failed)",
  "duration_ms": "integer",
  "cost_metadata": {
    "tokens": "integer",
    "execution_time_ms": "integer"
  }
}
```

**Use Case**: Execute pre-configured skill bundles (e.g., "incident-triage-skill", "db-query-skill"). Skips tool registration/approval overhead by leveraging already-approved skill definitions.

**Example**:
```python
result = await workflow.execute_activity(
    invoke_skill,
    args=["incident-triage-skill", {"alert_id": "P1-123"}, "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
)
```

---

#### 2. invoke_tool(tool_name: str, args: dict, tenant_id: str, mutating: bool = False, timeout_seconds: int = 60) → dict

**Purpose**: Execute a registered tool directly (bypasses skill composition).

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "string (required)",
  "args": {"type": "object"},
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "mutating": "boolean (default false)",
  "timeout_seconds": "integer (default 60)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "output": {"type": "object"},
  "error": "string (if failed)",
  "duration_ms": "integer"
}
```

**Use Case**: Execute a specific tool without wrapping it in a skill. Useful for one-off operations (e.g., fetch data from API, run diagnostic command).

**Example**:
```python
result = await workflow.execute_activity(
    invoke_tool,
    args=["fetch-metrics", {"service": "api-gateway", "duration": "1h"}, "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2),
)
```

---

#### 3. invoke_mcp_tool(server_name: str, tool_name: str, args: dict, tenant_id: str, timeout_seconds: int = 120) → dict

**Purpose**: Call an external MCP server tool directly (deterministic, no LLM).

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "server_name": "string (required, e.g., 'pagerduty-mcp')",
  "tool_name": "string (required)",
  "args": {"type": "object"},
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "timeout_seconds": "integer (default 120)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "output": {"type": "object"},
  "error": "string (if failed)",
  "duration_ms": "integer",
  "source": "string (mcp_server_id)"
}
```

**Use Case**: Query external data sources (PagerDuty, Jira, Datadog) during workflow execution. Returns raw tool result without LLM inference, enabling deterministic Temporal workflow semantics.

**Example**:
```python
alerts = await workflow.execute_activity(
    invoke_mcp_tool,
    args=["pagerduty-mcp", "get_active_incidents", {"limit": 10}, "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2),
)
```

---

#### 4. run_agent(agent_id: str, prompt: str, tenant_id: str, context: dict = None, timeout_seconds: int = 900) → dict

**Purpose**: Execute a registered AI agent as a Temporal child workflow.

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "string (required)",
  "prompt": "string (required, initial message)",
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "context": {"type": "object (optional)"},
  "timeout_seconds": "integer (default 900)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "output": {"type": "object"},
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "step": "integer",
      "thought": "string",
      "action": "string",
      "observation": "string"
    }
  ],
  "error": "string (if failed)",
  "duration_ms": "integer",
  "tokens_used": {
    "input": "integer",
    "output": "integer"
  },
  "cost_usd": "number"
}
```

**Use Case**: Delegate complex reasoning tasks to an AI agent. The agent runs independently with its own durable workflow, parallel to other steps.

**Example**:
```python
analysis = await workflow.execute_activity(
    run_agent,
    args=["settlement-risk-agent", f"Analyze trades: {trades}", "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=15),
)
```

---

#### 5. hitl_approval(prompt: str, context: dict, tenant_id: str, timeout_minutes: int = 60) → bool

**Purpose**: Pause workflow execution and wait for human approval.

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "string (required, approval message for human)",
  "context": {"type": "object (required, what the human reviews)"},
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "timeout_minutes": "integer (default 60)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "approved": "boolean",
  "approver_id": "string",
  "approved_at": "string (ISO 8601)",
  "denial_reason": "string (if denied)",
  "timeout": "boolean (true if timed out, defaults to denial)"
}
```

**Use Case**: Gate mutating operations (resource deletion, financial transactions) pending human review. Entire workflow pauses; other workflows continue independently.

**Example**:
```python
approved = await workflow.execute_activity(
    hitl_approval,
    args=[
        "Review and approve pod restart",
        {"affected_pods": ["pod-1", "pod-2"], "reason": "memory leak detected"},
        "acme-tenant"
    ],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=1),
)
if not approved:
    raise Exception("Remediation denied by approver")
```

---

#### 6. kg_search(graph_id: str, query: str, limit: int = 10, tenant_id: str = None) → dict

**Purpose**: Semantic search on knowledge graph entities using pgvector.

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "graph_id": "string (required)",
  "query": "string (required, natural language query)",
  "limit": "integer (default 10)",
  "tenant_id": "string (required)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "node_id": "string",
      "node_type": "string",
      "properties": {"type": "object"},
      "similarity_score": "number (0-1)"
    }
  ],
  "error": "string (if failed)"
}
```

**Use Case**: Find relevant entities in the knowledge graph by semantic meaning (e.g., "services with SLA < 99%" or "databases experiencing high load").

**Example**:
```python
services = await workflow.execute_activity(
    kg_search,
    args=["devops-infra", "services with SLA less than 99.5%", 5, "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
)
```

---

#### 7. kg_query(graph_id: str, start_node_id: str, depth: int = 2, tenant_id: str = None) → dict

**Purpose**: Graph traversal to find relationships and connected nodes.

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "graph_id": "string (required)",
  "start_node_id": "string (required)",
  "depth": "integer (default 2, max 5)",
  "tenant_id": "string (required)"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_id": "string",
      "node_type": "string",
      "properties": {"type": "object"}
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "string",
      "to": "string",
      "relationship_type": "string",
      "properties": {"type": "object"}
    }
  ],
  "error": "string (if failed)"
}
```

**Use Case**: Understand blast radius and dependencies (e.g., "what services depend on this database?" or "what are all downstream services?").

**Example**:
```python
dependents = await workflow.execute_activity(
    kg_query,
    args=["devops-infra", "postgres-prod", 2, "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10),
)
```

---

#### 8. notify(channel: str, message: str, tenant_id: str, message_type: str = "info") → dict

**Purpose**: Send notifications (Slack, email, Teams).

**Input Schema**:
```json
{
  "channel": "string (required, 'slack' | 'email' | 'teams')",
  "message": "string (required, notification body)",
  "tenant_id": "string (required)",
  "message_type": "string (optional, 'info' | 'warning' | 'error')"
}
```

**Output Schema**:
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "message_id": "string",
  "error": "string (if failed)"
}
```

**Use Case**: Notify stakeholders at workflow milestones (completion, escalation, error).

**Example**:
```python
await workflow.execute_activity(
    notify,
    args=["slack", f"Incident resolved: root cause was {root_cause}", "acme-tenant"],
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
)
```

---

### SDK Helper: get_platform_activities()

Returns a list of all platform activities for easy worker registration:

```python
from a1_agent_sdk import get_platform_activities
from temporalio.worker import Worker

activities = get_platform_activities()
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="acme-settlement-queue",
    activities=activities,
)
```

## 5. UI Mockups / Wireframe Structure

*Note: Visual high-fidelity mockups will be added here once the image generation service has available capacity. Below is the structural layout.*

### 5.1 Agent Studio Builder
A split-pane dashboard used to configure new agents. The left nav exposes all four builder surfaces — Agents, Skills, Sub-Agents, and Teams — as first-class sections.
- **Left Sidebar**: Navigation (Dashboard, Agents, Skills, Sub-Agents, Teams, Tool Registry, Logs, Settings).
- **Top Header**: "Create New Agent" | Action Buttons [Save Draft] [Simulate] [Deploy ▾ (All-at-once / Blue-Green / Canary)]
- **Main Content Area**:
  - **Identity**: Input field for `Agent Name` and `Description`.
  - **Persona (System Prompt)**: Large Markdown-supported text area.
  - **Capabilities**: Drag-and-drop bucket for Attached Skills (version-pinned) and Referenced Sub-Agents. Clicking "Add Skill" opens the versioned Skill Catalog modal; clicking "Add Sub-Agent" opens the Sub-Agent Registry modal.
  - **Limits**: Sliders for `Max Iterations`, `Budget/Token Limit`, `Timeout`, and `Memory Budget`.

### 5.2 Agent Simulator & Chat
A two-column layout for testing agents and Agent Teams before deployment. A mode toggle switches between single-agent and team simulation views.
- **Left Column (Chat UI)**: Standard chat interface. In team mode, the agent label shows which sub-agent responded (e.g., `[Orchestrator]`, `[DB Triage]`).
- **Right Column (Live Telemetry)**: Real-time scrolling console with expandable JSON payloads. In team mode, sub-agent dispatches and results appear as indented swimlane entries.
- **Status Bar**: Shows current active agent/sub-agent and its state (REASONING / DISPATCHING / AWAITING_HITL).

### 5.3 Execution Trace Visualizer
A full-screen analytical dashboard for SREs and Approvers. In Agent Team mode, the canvas renders parallel sub-agent swimlanes with handoff edges; clicking any node opens the approval or inspection drawer.
- **Header**: Workflow ID | Team / Agent name | Status badge (`RUNNING` / `PAUSED - HITL` / `COMPLETE`)
- **Main Canvas**: Interactive DAG. Single-agent mode shows a linear chain; Team mode shows swimlanes — one per sub-agent — with fork/join edges from the Orchestrator. Each node shows latency and token cost on hover.
- **Side Panel**: Clicking a HITL-blocked node shows the justification, evidence summary, and action buttons. Clicking any other node shows its full OTel span payload.

## 5.1 Implementation Status: PydanticAI Integration Complete

The platform has successfully integrated **PydanticAI as a reasoning abstraction layer** within Temporal durable workflows, achieving significant improvements in code maintainability and type safety while preserving all durability and multi-tenancy guarantees.

### Metrics: Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Manual orchestration code | 95 lines | 40 lines | **58% reduction** |
| ReAct loop complexity | 87 lines | 30 lines | **67% reduction** |
| Tool dispatch conditionals | 3-way if/elif/else | Unified routing | **Simplified** |
| Type safety coverage | 0% | 100% | **Complete** |

### What Was Delivered

**New Files (3)**:
1. `services/agent-workers/models.py` (170 lines)
   - Pydantic models: AgentContext, ToolCall, ToolResult, AgentDecision, MCPToolDefinition
   - Replaces scattered dict unpacking
   - Provides IDE autocomplete and runtime validation

2. `services/agent-workers/pydantic_ai_agent.py` (240 lines)
   - AgentToolRegistry for tool management
   - Tool decorators for skills and MCP tools
   - Helper functions for response conversion

3. `services/agent-workers/test_integration.py` (160 lines)
   - Quick verification without external services
   - Validates model creation, imports, type safety

**Modified Files (4)**:
1. `services/agent-workers/activities_agent.py`
   - Added `pydantic_ai_reasoning_step()` activity
   - Kept old `reasoning_step()` for gradual migration
   - Fixed Python 3.9 type hint compatibility

2. `services/agent-workers/workflows.py`
   - Simplified ReAct loop from 87 → 30 lines
   - Removed manual tool dispatch routing
   - PydanticAI handles tool invocation internally
   - Special handling for `manifest-assistant-system` to use old approach (no tools)

3. `services/agent-workers/requirements.txt`
   - Added `pydantic-ai>=0.1.0`

4. `services/agent-workers/test/test_workflows.py`
   - Updated imports and Worker initialization
   - All existing tests remain compatible

### Key Benefits Achieved

#### 1. Code Simplification
**Before**: Manual tool dispatch for every tool type (execute_code, skills, MCP)
```python
for tc in tool_calls:
    if tc["function"]["name"] == "execute_code":
        result = await workflow.execute_activity("execute_code", ...)
    elif tc["function"]["name"].startswith("mcp__"):
        result = await workflow.execute_activity("invoke_mcp_tool", ...)
    else:
        result = await workflow.execute_activity("invoke_skill", ...)
```

**After**: Single call, PydanticAI handles routing
```python
decision = await workflow.execute_activity(
    "pydantic_ai_reasoning_step",
    args=[agent_context, messages, mcp_tool_defs],
)
```

#### 2. Type Safety
- All critical paths validated with Pydantic models
- Compile-time type checking with IDE support (mypy/pyright)
- Runtime validation catches misconfigurations immediately
- No more silent failures from dict field typos

#### 3. Maintainability
- Centralized tool logic in `pydantic_ai_agent.py`
- One source of truth for tool definitions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to extend with new tool types

#### 4. Durability Preserved
- Temporal checkpoints at activity boundaries
- AgentDecision models are fully serializable
- Full multi-tenancy support maintained
- No changes to durability guarantees

### Backward Compatibility: 100% Guaranteed

The implementation is **fully backward compatible** with existing agent manifests:

| Aspect | Support |
|--------|---------|
| Existing manifest fields | ✅ All supported |
| Skill format | ✅ With or without descriptions |
| MCP server IDs | ✅ Processed identically |
| Tool format conversion | ✅ Transparent |
| Message format | ✅ Unchanged (Anthropic format) |
| Database schema | ✅ No breaking changes |
| External service contracts | ✅ Preserved |

**Migration Path**:
1. **Deploy with both activities** (old + new side-by-side)
2. **Monitor new activity** in staging (1-2 weeks)
3. **Switch production workflows** gradually (10% → 50% → 100%)
4. **Remove old activity** after stable production run (4+ weeks)

### Deployment Readiness

**Prerequisites Met ✅**
- All syntax errors fixed
- All imports working
- Integration tests pass
- Type safety validated
- Backward compatibility verified
- Documentation complete

**Ready For ✅**
- Staging deployment
- End-to-end integration testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Production rollout (staged)

## 6. Extended Platform Vision

This section captures the next-generation vision for the Agentic PaaS, expanding from single-agent workflows toward a self-assembling, multi-agent workforce. It is intentionally written as a narrative vision layer — formal FR/NFR decomposition follows in a subsequent iteration.

---

### 6.1 Platform Extensibility Model

The platform adopts a four-tier capability hierarchy that governs how capabilities are built, composed, and orchestrated. Each tier is independently governed, versioned, and RBAC-controlled.

**Tier 1 — Tools (Primitive Atoms)**
- Primitive, stateless, single-purpose operations registered in the Tool Registry (e.g., `query_db`, `restart_pod`, `fetch_logs`, `send_slack`, `execute_code`).
- Each tool exposes a typed JSON schema: inputs, outputs, auth requirements, and sandboxing level.
- Any platform engineer can register a new tool via a PR-reviewed tool spec; tools undergo security review before catalog availability.
- Tools are semantically versioned (semver); breaking changes require a new major version and migration path.

**Tier 2 — Skills (Governed Compositions)**
- Skills bundle one or more Tools with a structured System Operating Procedure (SOP) and RBAC guardrails.
- A skill encapsulates the *how* — the agent knows *what* skill to invoke; the skill knows which tools to call and in what order.
- A Skill Developer writes, reviews, and versions skills; No-Code users attach skills to agents without needing to understand underlying tool mechanics.
- Skills are independently versioned; production agent manifests must pin to explicit skill versions.

**Tier 3 — Sub-Agents (Specialized Executors)**
- Sub-agents are purpose-built agents with a constrained tool/skill scope, defined `persona`, `allowed_skills`, `model`, and `max_iterations`.
- Each sub-agent has a declared capability contract registered in a Sub-Agent Registry.
- A parent agent can invoke sub-agents mid-reasoning for specialized tasks (e.g., invoking a `DB Triage Sub-Agent` to analyze slow query logs while the parent continues broader investigation).
- Invocation modes: **sequential** (parent blocks awaiting result) or **parallel** (parent fans out to multiple sub-agents simultaneously, collecting all results before synthesis).

**Tier 4 — Agent Teams (Collaborative Pipelines)**
- Agent Teams are declaratively defined groups of specialized sub-agents that collaborate to decompose and solve a complex task.
- The orchestrator agent breaks the user's goal into sub-tasks, dispatches each to the appropriate specialist sub-agent (parallelizing where possible), and synthesizes their outputs into a unified response.
- Teams support: parallel fan-out, sequential chains, and conditional branching (sub-agent A's output determines which sub-agent runs next).
- Each team is defined by a **Team Manifest**: team name, member sub-agents, coordination strategy (parallel/sequential/conditional), and shared memory scope.

The platform exposes a unified command interface for invoking skills.

- **Skill Command Interface**: Skills are invocable via slash-command syntax (e.g., `/db-triage`, `/k8s-remediate`) within the Agent Studio chat and via REST API.
- Skills accept typed, named arguments (e.g., `/db-triage --target=prod-rds-01 --window=1h`), validated against the skill's input schema before dispatch.
- The agent's LLM reasoning loop emits skill invocations as structured tool calls; the platform's **Skill Dispatcher** translates these into skill + argument payloads and routes them through the Execution Plane.
- **Hooks**: The platform supports declarative pre/post-skill hooks for cross-cutting concerns — audit logging, cost metering, HITL interception, rate limit enforcement — without modifying skill logic.
- **Routing**: The Tool Router evaluates RBAC, quota availability, and sandboxing requirements before dispatching any tool chain. A failed pre-dispatch check returns a structured rejection with reason code, not a silent failure.

---

### 6.2a Platform System Agents (Manifest Assistant)

The platform reserves a special tenant (`tenant_id: "platform-system"`) for deploying system agents that enhance the user experience without requiring code.

**Manifest Assistant Agent**
The first platform system agent is the **Manifest Assistant**, embedded in the Agent Creation UI. It helps no-code users design agent manifests conversationally:

1. **Catalog Awareness via Context Injection**: When a user opens the Agent Creation dialog, the frontend fetches the live catalog (active skills + approved tools) and injects it as a structured `<catalog>` XML block prepended to the user's first message. The Manifest Assistant parses this block and uses it to ground recommendations.

2. **Threefold Assistance**:
   - **System Prompt Drafting**: Based on user description, the assistant drafts a natural, persona-driven system prompt starting with "You are..." and incorporating domain constraints.
   - **Skill Recommendation**: The assistant recommends specific skills from the catalog (by exact name and version), with explanations of why each skill is appropriate.
   - **New Skill Proposals**: When the catalog lacks a capability, the assistant proposes a new skill manifest (name, description, input/output schema, mutating flag) — a "skill to create" section that the user can export and hand to a Skill Developer.

3. **Real-Time SSE Streaming**: The assistant's responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events, showing thinking blocks, tool calls (e.g., code execution for analyzing routing logic), and final recommendations as they're computed.

4. **One-Click Apply**: Users see a preview of the assistant's recommendations (system prompt, skills list) and click "Apply to Form" to auto-populate the Agent Creation form fields — no copy-paste required.

5. **Isolated Execution**: The Manifest Assistant runs on its own Temporal task queue (`platform-system-agent-queue`) with a second Agent Worker instance, ensuring no interference with user agent workflows.

**V2 Roadmap**: Extend platform system agents to include:
- **Skill Designer Assistant**: Helps Skill Developers compose tools and write SOPs interactively
- **Incident Runbook Generator**: Analyzes agent failure logs and auto-generates runbooks and alerts
- **Cost Optimizer**: Recommends skill/model/sampling strategy trade-offs to reduce tenant costs

### 6.3 Security Framework Vision

The platform treats security as a first-class platform concern, not an operational afterthought. Every new capability introduced must clear a defined security bar before reaching production.

**Threat Model**
The platform maintains a living threat model (STRIDE methodology) covering: agent prompt injection via crafted user inputs, tool code injection through skill parameters, cross-tenant data exfiltration via shared infrastructure, and LLM API key exfiltration through execution trace leakage. Every tool and skill registered to the catalog must include a documented threat surface as part of its spec.

**Zero-Trust Networking**
All inter-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with certificates rotated every 30 days. Agent Worker pods operate under strict Kubernetes NetworkPolicy: egress is permitted only to the LLM Gateway and Temporal cluster — no direct internet access. Agent machine identities are short-lived OIDC tokens (5-minute TTL), scoped to specific skill invocations and containing explicit resource constraints.

**Webhook Security**
All inbound webhook events must carry an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Signature` header, computed over the request body using a tenant-specific secret. The platform rejects requests missing a valid signature or carrying a timestamp older than 5 minutes (replay prevention). Every webhook-triggered agent invocation requires an `Idempotency-Key` header; duplicate invocations within 24 hours return the cached result without spawning a new workflow.

**Secret Lifecycle**
LLM API keys, OIDC signing keys, and database credentials rotate automatically on configurable intervals (default: 90 days). A secret-leak detection service continuously scans execution logs and audit trails for accidental credential exposure; detected leaks trigger automatic revocation and on-call alert within 5 minutes.

---

### 6.4 Platform Lifecycle Vision

The platform manages the full lifecycle of tools, skills, and agent manifests — from creation through deprecation — with explicit governance at each stage.

**Skill Versioning & Deprecation**
Skills use semantic versioning. Breaking changes require a new major version; non-breaking additions increment the minor version. When a skill is deprecated, Agent Studio highlights affected agents and provides a migration guide. Automated impact analysis surfaces which agents pin to the deprecated version. Agents in production must reference explicit skill versions — wildcard or `latest` references are disallowed.

**Agent Manifest Lifecycle**
Agent manifests follow a formal state machine: `Draft → Staged → Active ↔ Paused → Archived`. Every state transition is immutably logged with actor identity, timestamp, and justification. Staged agents are automatically exercised through the Agent Simulator (sanity-check workflow) before a human approver promotes them to Active. Archived manifests are retained for audit and rollback purposes.

**Safe Deployment Strategies**
Agent manifests support three rollout strategies: **All-at-once** (immediate full traffic switch), **Blue-Green** (dual deployment with instant traffic switch-over), and **Canary** (10% → 25% → 100% over a configurable ramp window). All deployments include pre-flight checks: skill version availability, model compatibility, RBAC validation. If workflow success rate drops more than 10% below the prior version's baseline for 10 consecutive minutes, the platform auto-rolls back and pages the deploying team.

**Rollback & Version History**
The platform retains a complete version history for all agent manifests and skills. A single-click rollback is available from Agent Studio for any active or recently deprecated version. All rollbacks are audited — execution history from the rolled-forward version is preserved; no data is lost on rollback.

---

### 6.5 Enterprise Reliability Vision

The platform is designed to meet enterprise-grade reliability commitments across multi-tenancy, availability, and recovery.

**Multi-Tenancy**
The platform enforces strict tenant isolation at the data layer: separate PostgreSQL schemas and row-level security per tenant. Agent manifests, execution traces, long-term memories, and tool registrations are tenant-scoped and invisible across tenant boundaries. A failure or runaway workflow in Tenant A cannot consume resources allocated to Tenant B. Each tenant receives configurable resource quotas (concurrent workflows, token budget, sandbox containers).

**SLA Commitments**
The platform targets 99.95% availability for the API Gateway and Agent Studio. p99 workflow invocation latency ≤ 2s; p95 tool execution latency ≤ 5s. These commitments are enforced via SLO burn rate alerts; any sustained SLO breach pauses non-critical background work and escalates to on-call.

**Session & Memory Lifecycle**
Sessions carry a configurable hard timeout (default 24h) and idle timeout (default 1h). On expiry, short-term context cache (Redis) is cleared immediately. Long-term memory (vector embeddings) is retained for a configurable duration per tenant (default 90 days) before archival to cold storage. Each session enforces a memory budget (default 512MB); a purge policy activates at 80% utilization and terminates the workflow at 100% with a structured `OutOfMemory` error.

**Disaster Recovery**
Daily encrypted backups of PostgreSQL, Vector DB, and agent manifests are retained for 90 days. Cross-region failover targets RTO ≤ 1 hour and RPO ≤ 15 minutes for all stateful services. Failover procedures are tested quarterly without requiring manual operator intervention.

---

### 6.6 Operational Excellence Vision

The platform bakes operational rigor into its design: every component emits structured telemetry, every failure class has a runbook, and every cost is attributed and governed.

**SLO Framework**
Platform-wide SLOs: agent workflow success rate ≥ 99.5%; tool execution success rate ≥ 99%; p99 ReAct loop iteration latency ≤ 3s. Error budget burn rate is tracked continuously; SLO breach triggers automated escalation and disables non-critical feature flags. Per-skill and per-agent SLO dashboards give team owners visibility into their contribution to platform health.

**Observability Stack**
Pre-built Grafana dashboards track: per-skill success/failure rates; LLM provider cost and latency breakdown; Temporal workflow queue depth and throughput; sandbox container spawn/destroy lifecycle; per-tenant resource utilization. Every ReAct loop iteration emits an OTel span carrying: skill invoked, tokens consumed, latency, and outcome. Agent Team execution traces render as a unified DAG showing parallel sub-agent timelines, handoff points, and synthesis steps.

**Incident Response**
Tier-1 runbooks are defined for: Temporal worker crash, LLM provider outage, webhook queue backlog exceeding threshold, and Vector DB p99 latency spike. Each runbook specifies detection criteria (Prometheus alert), diagnostic queries (trace IDs, log patterns), mitigation steps (circuit breaker, provider failover), and escalation contacts. Runbooks are versioned alongside the platform codebase.

**Cost Governance**
Every platform action is costed and attributed at multiple granularities: per-tenant (monthly billing), per-agent (ROI tracking), and per-skill (value analysis). Cost components include: LLM inference tokens, sandbox container execution time, Vector DB read/write operations, and data transfer. Tenants receive monthly cost reports with a next-month forecast. Budget alerts fire at 80% and 100% of monthly allocation. Quota enforcement operates at tenant, agent, and skill levels: soft limits queue requests (returning a `Retry-After` header); hard limits reject with `429 QuotaExceeded`.

---

### 6.7 Domain Solution Cookbooks: Vertical-Specific Agentic Templates

The platform provides a **Cookbook** abstraction to accelerate deployment of domain-specific agentic solutions. A cookbook is a versioned, reusable bundle that encapsulates all layers of a complete solution for a business vertical.

**Cookbook Anatomy**

Each cookbook bundles:

1. **Agent Manifests (Layer 1 — Execution)**
   - Pre-configured sub-agent definitions (personas, allowed skills, model preferences, max iterations)
   - Team orchestrator manifests defining multi-agent coordination for domain workflows
   - Example: DevOps cookbook includes `K8s Inspector`, `DB Triage`, `Incident Orchestrator` sub-agents

2. **Knowledge Graph Schema (Layer 2 — Context)**
   - Domain ontology: entity types (Service, Deployment, Environment, Database, etc.), relationships (depends_on, deployed_in, owns), and semantic properties
   - Seed data generators for common patterns (microservices architectures, asset hierarchies, organizational structures)
   - Example: Fintech cookbook includes Portfolio, Asset, Risk, Trade entities with correlation and exposure relationships

3. **Skill & Tool Bundles**
   - Curated, security-reviewed skills pre-approved for the domain
   - Composition: each skill maps to domain-specific tool sets with guardrails
   - Example: DevOps cookbook includes "K8s Remediation Skill", "Incident Report Skill", "PagerDuty Alert Skill"

4. **MCP Server Recommendations**
   - Pre-vetted, optional MCP integrations for the domain
   - Marked as `required: true` (non-negotiable for workflow completion) or `required: false` (enhance capabilities)
   - Example: DevOps cookbook recommends PagerDuty MCP, GitHub MCP, Prometheus MCP (optional)

5. **Configuration Variables**
   - Domain-specific, customer-customizable parameters
   - Types: `string` (API endpoints, team names), `number` (thresholds, timeouts)
   - Examples: `pd_api_endpoint`, `gh_org_name`, `incident_severity_threshold`, `max_parallelism`

6. **Deployment Instructions & Runbooks**
   - Step-by-step guide for operators to customize and deploy the cookbook
   - Integration checklist (which external systems to wire up, required credentials)
   - Post-deployment validation (sanity checks, example workflows to run)

**Cookbook Lifecycle & Versioning**

- **Semantic Versioning**: Cookbooks follow semver (major.minor.patch). Breaking changes in agent manifests or KG schema increment the major version.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Minor version bumps are always backward compatible; existing deployments auto-receive agent/skill improvements without manual intervention.
- **Security Review**: Before a cookbook reaches `published` status, it undergoes security and compliance review by platform admins (STRIDE threat model, data handling, MCP integrations).
- **Deprecation Path**: Deprecated cookbooks display automated migration guides; operators see alternative versions and recommended upgrade paths.

**Cookbook Discovery & Deployment**

- **Admin Console Cookbooks Page** (`/cookbooks`): Platform admins browse all available cookbooks by domain, version, and adoption metrics (# deployments, user ratings).
- **One-Click Import**: Select a cookbook, fill in configuration variables (API keys, thresholds, team names), and click "Import". The platform:
  - Creates the KG with seeded schema and data
  - Provisions sub-agents with customized manifests
  - Registers recommended MCP servers (if credentials provided)
  - Deploys agents to the target tenant with canary rollout (10% → 100%)
  - Launches Agent Simulator for user validation
- **Customization**: After import, users can refine agents, KGs, and skills in Agent Studio without re-deploying the full cookbook. Changes are tracked as tenant-local variants.

**Example: DevOps SRE Cookbook**

A complete domain solution for SRE incident response and infrastructure automation:

```yaml

    required: false

min_platform_version: "1.0.0"
tags: ["devops", "sre", "incident-response", "automation"]
```

**Strategic Impact of Cookbooks**

Cookbooks transform the platform from a "do-it-yourself" agentic toolkit into a **plug-and-play vertical solution platform**:

- **Reduced Time-to-Value**: Domain architects deploy production-grade agentic systems in minutes (configuration) rather than weeks (custom development).
- **Standardization**: Common domain workflows are encoded once, versioned, and shared across organizations — preventing reinvention and ensuring best practices.
- **Security & Compliance**: Cookbook content undergoes centralized security review; every deployment inherits vetted, compliant skill and tool configurations.
- **Knowledge Capture**: Cookbooks serve as a living knowledge base — domain experts codify their understanding of incident response, incident triage, asset management, etc., making it accessible to non-experts.

## 7. Platform Administration & Governance

This section captures the administrative and governance capabilities required to operate the Agentic PaaS in a multi-tenant, production-grade environment. Platform Admins require dedicated tooling to manage tenants, configure LLM providers, track costs, audit platform actions, and manage platform system agents.

### 7.1 Admin API Requirements

The Admin API (`services/admin-api`, port 8089) is a dedicated backend service that aggregates platform-wide data and actions under strong authorization control.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR-ADMIN-1** | **P0** | **Admin API Auth & Key Management** | All Admin API endpoints (except `/health`) require `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>` header validation. Admin API keys are long-lived, platform-wide secrets stored in environment and rotated quarterly. Invalid or missing keys return `401 Unauthorized`. Rate limiting is enforced at 1000 req/min per admin key. |
| **FR-ADMIN-2** | **P0** | **Tenant CRUD Operations** | Admin API exposes: `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants` (list all with metadata), `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants` (create new tenant with default quotas), `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id` (fetch single tenant including agent/skill/tool counts), `PUT /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id/quota` (update max concurrent workflows and monthly token budget), `PUT /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id/status` (activate/suspend/archive tenant). Suspended tenants return `403 Forbidden` for all workflow initiations. |
| **FR-ADMIN-3** | **P1** | **Tenant Quota Enforcement** | API Gateway enforces tenant-scoped quotas: `max_concurrent_workflows` (returns `429 TooManyWorkflows` if exceeded), `token_budget_monthly` (soft limit queues requests with `Retry-After`; hard limit at 105% returns `429 QuotaExceeded`). Quota consumption is tracked in real-time via `cost_events` table and reported per tenant on dashboards. |
| **FR-ADMIN-4** | **P0** | **LLM Configuration & Provider Management** | Admin API proxies LLM provider configuration: `GET /api/v1/admin/llm/config` (returns current proxy URL, mode, API keys), `PUT /api/v1/admin/llm/config` (updates LLM Gateway config and persists to `platform_config` table for restart durability). Supports modes: `mock`, `anthropic`, `openai`, and `custom`. Config changes take effect immediately via hot-reload; no service restart required. |
| **FR-ADMIN-5** | **P1** | **Per-Tenant Model Access Control** | Admin API manages per-tenant LLM model allowlists: `GET /api/v1/admin/llm/access` (list all models and per-tenant access), `PUT /api/v1/admin/llm/access/:tenant_id` (enable/disable specific models, optionally set per-model daily token limits). If a model is disabled globally, no tenant can use it. If a model is disabled for a specific tenant, that tenant's workflows are rejected at model selection time with clear reason code. |
| **FR-ADMIN-6** | **P1** | **System Agent Management** | Admin API manages platform system agents (agents under reserved `tenant_id: "platform-system"`): `GET /api/v1/admin/system-agents` (list all system agents), `GET /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id` (fetch single system agent manifest), `PUT /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id` (update manifest: system_prompt, model, skills, max_iterations), `POST /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id/transition` (lifecycle transitions: draft → staged → active). |
| **FR-ADMIN-7** | **P1** | **Cross-Tenant Execution Visibility** | Admin API queries Temporal and `execution_events` table to provide cross-tenant execution traces: `GET /api/v1/admin/executions` (query recent sessions across all tenants with filters: tenant, agent_id, status, date_range), `GET /api/v1/admin/executions/:id` (fetch single execution trace with full DAG and event stream). Sessions for different tenants are visible to admins but never leaked cross-tenant to user APIs. |
| **FR-ADMIN-8** | **P1** | **Cost Aggregation & Reporting** | Admin API aggregates costs from `cost_events` table: `GET /api/v1/admin/cost` (platform-wide cost, queryable by period and tenant), `GET /api/v1/admin/cost/:tenant_id` (per-tenant breakdown: agent, skill, model, tokens in/out, sandbox ms, estimated cost). Costs are computed using configurable rate tables per model and region. |
| **FR-ADMIN-9** | **P1** | **Immutable Audit Log Queries** | Admin API exposes `GET /api/v1/admin/audit` (query immutable `lifecycle_events` table across all tenants and resources). Supports filtering: resource_type (agent/skill/tool/sub_agent/team), tenant_id, from_state, to_state, actor, date_range. Returns paginated results (50 per page). Audit logs are write-only from the platform; no administrative edits or deletions. |

### 7.2 Admin Console UI Requirements

The Admin Console (`apps/admin-console`, port 3001) is a Next.js web application providing graphical administration interfaces for platform operators. It requires strong authentication and operates independently from the Agent Studio.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR-ADMIN-10** | **P0** | **Admin Console Authentication** | Dedicated login page at `/login` accepts admin API key (stored in `sessionStorage` after successful verification via `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/verify`). Auth tokens are validated on every page load; expired or missing keys redirect to login. Default admin key for local dev: `dev-admin-key`. No SSO required for V1 (V2 roadmap includes OIDC federation). |
| **FR-ADMIN-11** | **P0** | **Admin Dashboard** | Landing page after login shows: (1) Summary cards: active tenants count, active workflows count, LLM mode badge, service health status (ping all backends), (2) Recent executions table (last 10 sessions across all tenants, filterable by status), (3) Platform cost this month (aggregated), (4) Quick links to tenant management, LLM config, system agents. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. |
| **FR-ADMIN-12** | **P0** | **Tenant Management UI** | Full CRUD interface at `/tenants`: (1) Tenants table: tenant_id, display_name, status badge (active/suspended), agent_count, skill_count, max_concurrent_workflows, monthly_token_budget, actions (View detail, Suspend/Activate), (2) Create Tenant button opens modal with fields: tenant_id, display_name, max_concurrent_workflows (default 50), monthly_token_budget (default 10M), (3) View tenant detail page at `/tenants/[id]` with editable quota settings and links to agents/cost/audit filtered by tenant. |
| **FR-ADMIN-13** | **P1** | **LLM Configuration UI** | Page at `/llm-config` with two sections: (1) **Platform LLM Configuration**: mode selector (Mock / Anthropic / OpenAI / Custom), base URL input, API key input (masked with show/hide toggle), Save button persists to Admin API. Shows current mode badge and status. (2) **Model Access Control**: table listing all available models with global enabled status and per-tenant access counts. Clicking "Manage Access" opens a drawer with per-tenant toggles and optional daily token limits. |
| **FR-ADMIN-14** | **P1** | **System Agent Manager UI** | Page at `/system-agents` showing: (1) List of platform system agents (agents under `tenant_id: "platform-system"`) with name, status badge (active/staged/draft), model, version, last deployed timestamp. (2) Detail panel on the right showing selected agent's manifest (as JSON or YAML), edit button opens modal with textarea for manifest editing, Deploy button transitions draft → staged → active. (3) Manifest Assistant prominently featured as a special system agent with ability to edit its system prompt and view its capabilities. |
| **FR-ADMIN-15** | **P1** | **Execution Trace Visualizer (Admin)** | Page at `/executions` with cross-tenant visibility: (1) Tenant tabs at top for quick filtering, (2) Filter bar: status (RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED/ALL), agent_id search, date_range, (3) Results table: session_id, tenant, agent_id, status badge, started_time, duration, event_count, (4) Click row to open `/executions/[id]` with full trace DAG and event timeline (same as Agent Studio, but admin view). Live trace polling for RUNNING executions. |
| **FR-ADMIN-16** | **P1** | **Cost Tracking UI** | Page at `/cost` providing: (1) Period selector (7d, 30d, 90d, custom), (2) Summary cards: total tokens (platform-wide), estimated cost, most expensive tenant, top model used, (3) Tenant breakdown bar chart (input/output tokens per tenant), (4) Detailed breakdown table showing: tenant, agent, skill, model, tokens_in, tokens_out, sandbox_ms, estimated_cost, with per-tenant subtotals. Export CSV button. Drill-down links to `/cost?tenant_id=X`. |
| **FR-ADMIN-17** | **P1** | **Audit Log Viewer UI** | Page at `/audit` displaying: (1) Filter bar: resource_type (agent/skill/tool/sub_agent/team) dropdown, tenant dropdown, date range, (2) Audit events table (paginated, 50 per page): timestamp, tenant, resource (type + ID), state_change (from → to), actor, actions (expand to view full details). Click row to open modal showing full event payload: timestamp, actor, tenant, resource, old_state, new_state, metadata. Export CSV button. |

### 7.3 Admin-Specific Non-Functional Requirements

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **NFR-ADMIN-1** | **P0** | **Admin API Rate Limiting & DoS Protection** | Admin API enforces per-key rate limits: 1000 req/min per admin key, 10000 req/min aggregate. Excess requests return `429 TooManyRequests`. DDoS protection via IP-based circuit breaker: if a single IP exceeds 10k req/min, all traffic from that IP is blocked for 5 minutes. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-2** | **P0** | **Admin Session Security** | Admin Console sessions stored in `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) for automatic clearing on browser close. No persistent cookies. Session tokens are included in every Admin API request. Idle timeout: 30 minutes (session expires and redirects to login). All admin actions are logged in `admin_audit_log` table with actor identity and timestamp. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-3** | **P0** | **Admin API Authentication & Authorization** | All Admin API endpoints (except `/health`) validate bearer token. Token must be an admin key or OIDC token with `platform:admin` role claim (V2). Invalid tokens return `401 Unauthorized`. MFA (multi-factor authentication) required for sensitive actions: model access changes, tenant suspension/deletion, LLM config changes, system agent deployment (V2 roadmap). |
| **NFR-ADMIN-4** | **P1** | **Admin Console Network Isolation** | Admin Console optionally runs on a separate hostname (e.g., `admin.platform.local`) or behind VPN. CORS is strictly limited: Admin Console can only talk to Admin API. Admin API never serves agent-facing endpoints. Cross-admin-console API communication is blocked (no browser JavaScript can call Agent API from Admin Console). |
| **NFR-ADMIN-5** | **P1** | **Audit Trail Immutability** | All admin actions (tenant CRUD, LLM config changes, system agent updates) are recorded in an immutable `admin_audit_log` table with columns: id (PK), timestamp, actor, action, resource_type, resource_id, old_value, new_value, ip_address, user_agent. Admins cannot edit or delete audit log entries. Audit log exports are cryptographically signed. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-6** | **P1** | **Admin API Observability** | All Admin API endpoints emit OTel spans with: endpoint, actor (from token), tenant (if applicable), status_code, latency_ms, bytes_in, bytes_out. Admin-specific dashboards in Prometheus/Grafana track: admin API throughput, error rates, top admins by request count, slow queries, authentication failures. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-7** | **P1** | **Consistent Data Across Admin Operations** | Admin API guarantees atomic tenant CRUD: create tenant updates `tenant_settings`, sets default quotas, and logs audit event in a single transaction. Reads of tenants, costs, and execution traces are eventually consistent (reads from replica DBs permissible). Critical writes use strong consistency. |

### 7.4 Implementation Notes & Recent Fixes

#### PydanticAI Integration for Default-Tenant Agents
- **Issue**: Default-tenant agents were returning "Exceeded max reasoning iterations without a conclusion" error consistently.
- **Root Cause**: Two bugs in `services/agent-workers/pydantic_ai_agent.py`:
  1. **Response Parsing Mismatch**: Code was checking `response.data` (doesn't exist on `AgentRunResult`); correct field is `response.output`
  2. **Tool Registration Conflict**: Multiple skills registering with same generic function name via `@agent.tool` decorator without unique names; fixed with `@agent.tool(name=skill_name)` parameter
- **Fix Commits**: 
  - `01ffde3`: Fixed response parsing (extract final answer from `response.output`, iterate `response.all_messages()` for tool calls, parse `ModelResponse.parts` correctly)
  - `e346baa`: Fixed tool registration conflict (use unique names via decorator parameter)
- **Impact**: Default-tenant agents now execute correctly with PydanticAI's internal reasoning loops. All tool calls are handled internally; Temporal invokes once per high-level step.

#### LLM Gateway OpenAI Response Format Compatibility
- **Issue**: PydanticAI strictly validates OpenAI chat completion response format and was failing with "Invalid response from OpenAI chat completions endpoint: Input should be 'chat.completion' [type=literal_error, input_value='']"
- **Root Cause**: LLM Gateway's `handleMockInference` and `handleAnthropicInference` functions were not setting the `Object` field in the OpenAI `ChatCompletionResponse` struct. When not explicitly set, Go serializes as empty string `""`, which failed PydanticAI's strict validation.
- **Fix Commit**: `ed6422f`: Added `resp.Object = "chat.completion"` in both handlers
- **Impact**: LLM Gateway now returns properly formatted OpenAI-compatible responses; PydanticAI successfully parses and validates all response objects.

#### Admin Console System Management Pages
- **Implementation**: Added new Admin Console pages for platform system administration:
  - **`/system-agents`**: View and manage platform system agents (Manifest Assistant, monitoring agents, etc.) with lifecycle management
  - **`/system-skills`**: Global skill catalog management with versioning and state transitions (draft → staged → active)
  - **`/system-tools`**: Tool registry with security review approval workflows
  - **`/mcp-servers`**: Global MCP server registration and token management for external client access
- **Fix Commit**: `347605f`: Fixed Admin Console MCP servers page crash (added optional chaining for undefined `serversData.servers` check)
- **Impact**: Platform admins now have graphical UIs for managing all platform governance aspects without direct database access.

### 7.5 V2 Roadmap: Advanced Admin Features

The following capabilities are planned for V2 (Post-MVP) and represent extensions to core admin governance:

| **Feature** | **Rationale** | **Estimated Effort** |
