# Enterprise Agentic PaaS: Requirement Specification

This document outlines the core functional and non-functional requirements for building an enterprise-grade Agentic Platform. It covers the full capability spectrum: from no-code agent creation and durable single-agent execution, through governed skill composition, to coordinated multi-agent teams — all underpinned by enterprise security, operational excellence, and strict compliance.

## 1. Platform Vision and Goals

### Platform Vision

To provide a secure, highly-scalable, and developer-friendly Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that transforms how enterprises build and operate AI-driven automation. The platform is structured around a four-tier capability hierarchy — Tools, Skills, Sub-Agents, and Agent Teams — that separates primitive execution from governed composition, and single-agent reasoning from coordinated multi-agent workflows.

At the base, platform engineers register primitive **Tools** (stateless, schema-typed API operations). Skill Developers compose Tools into reusable **Skills** with embedded SOPs and RBAC guardrails. Agent creators assemble Skills into **Sub-Agents** with defined personas and capability scopes. Finally, **Agent Teams** orchestrate multiple specialist sub-agents in parallel or sequential pipelines to tackle complex, multi-domain tasks — effectively deploying a self-assembling workforce on demand.

This architecture democratizes agent creation for no-code users while giving platform engineers deep, governed control over every primitive in the system. It ensures every AI action is auditable, every capability is versioned, and every cost is attributed — from a single tool call to a coordinated team execution.

### Strategic Goals

1. **Composable Agent Workforce:** Enable domain experts to deploy sophisticated AI workflows — spanning tool invocation, skill composition, and multi-agent collaboration — in hours rather than weeks, without writing code. Platform engineers control the governed primitives; no-code users assemble them.

2. **Enterprise-Grade Resilience:** Guarantee zero-data-loss execution across all tiers. Durable ReAct loops survive pod crashes, API limits, and transient failures. Agent Teams tolerate sub-agent failures gracefully, resuming exactly where execution left off.

3. **Zero-Trust Security by Design:** Every tool invocation uses a short-lived, scoped machine identity. All inter-service communication runs over mTLS. Inbound webhooks require HMAC signature validation. Secrets rotate automatically. A living threat model governs every new capability added to the platform.

4. **Governed Extensibility Without Lock-in:** The four-tier model is provider-agnostic throughout. LLMs, memory stores, and tool backends are pluggable. Any engineer can contribute a new Tool, Skill, or Sub-Agent through a standardized registration and security-review workflow.

5. **Operational Accountability:** Every platform action is observable, costed, and governed. SLOs are defined at workflow, skill, and tool granularity. Cost is attributed per tenant, per agent, and per skill. Quota enforcement, incident runbooks, and SLO burn-rate alerts ensure the platform operates predictably at enterprise scale.

## 2. Core User Journeys

To contextualize the platform's requirements, the following journeys illustrate how different personas interact with the Agentic PaaS.

### Journey 1: The "No-Code" Agent Creation (Persona: Domain Expert / Product Manager)

* **Step 1:** A Domain Expert logs into **Agent Studio** using Enterprise SSO.

* **Step 2:** They create a new agent. The **Agent Creation Dialog** now includes an **AI-Powered Manifest Assistant** panel that helps them design the agent. They describe what the agent should do (e.g., "Handle customer support ticket routing and escalation").

* **Step 3:** The **Manifest Assistant** converses naturally with them, drafting a "System Prompt" and recommending pre-approved **Skills** from the **Skill Catalog** (e.g., `Email Sender Skill v1.0.0`, `Ticket Database Skill v2.1.0`). The assistant understands the catalog of available skills and tools via context injection, and can propose new skills if catalog gaps exist. With one click, they apply the assistant's recommendations directly to the form.

* **Step 4:** Using a visual dropdown, they attach the assistant-recommended (or manually selected) **Skills** from the **Skill Catalog**. The Studio enforces explicit version pinning — wildcards are disallowed in production manifests. Under the hood, each skill safely bundles primitive tools with InfoSec-approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

* **Step 5:** They open the **Agent Simulator** in the Studio to chat with the drafted agent. They watch the execution trace graph in real-time to ensure it utilizes its skills correctly.

* **Step 6:** Satisfied, they select a **Canary** rollout strategy and click "Deploy." The platform generates the YAML manifest, provisions Temporal workers, and initially routes 10% of traffic to the new version — automatically rolling back if the workflow success rate drops below baseline.

### Journey 2: Resilient Task Execution (Persona: End User & System)

* **Step 1:** An End User asks the deployed agent to "Analyze yesterday's traffic spike and correlate it with any code deployments."

* **Step 2:** The Agent enters its **Durable Execution Loop** (ReAct). It successfully utilizes a `Metrics Analysis Skill` and then begins executing a `GitHub Audit Skill`.

* **Step 3:** *System Failure:* The EKS node running the Temporal Worker suddenly crashes due to underlying hardware failure.

* **Step 4:** *Recovery:* A new worker spins up on a healthy node. Thanks to Temporal, it does not restart the task or re-query the metrics. It seamlessly resumes the exact step where it failed. If the agent was operating as part of an Agent Team, the orchestrator detects the sub-agent failure, retries it on the healthy worker, and the team execution continues without restarting the other sub-agents.

* **Step 5:** The Agent finishes the analysis and returns the final correlated report to the user.

### Journey 3: Human-In-The-Loop Approval (Persona: Senior Engineer / Approver)

* **Step 1:** An automated monitoring agent detects a memory leak and decides the best course of action is to restart the affected pods.

* **Step 2:** It invokes its `Kubernetes Remediation Skill`, which attempts to call the primitive `restart_k8s_pod` tool.

* **Step 3:** The platform's RBAC engine intercepts this, noting the underlying tool is marked as "mutating" and requires human approval. The workflow enters a suspended state.

* **Step 4:** An alert is sent to a dedicated Slack channel with a link to the Agent Studio.

* **Step 5:** A Senior Engineer clicks the link, views the **Execution Trace Visualizer** (an interactive DAG showing exactly which logs the agent read and why it decided a restart was necessary), and clicks "Approve."

* **Step 6:** The workflow wakes up, executes the sandbox tool, and resolves the incident.

### Journey 4: Event-Driven Agent Triggering (Persona: Automated System)

* **Step 1:** An external observability tool (e.g., Datadog, PagerDuty) detects a sudden spike in 5xx errors and fires a webhook carrying an HMAC-SHA256 signature and an `Idempotency-Key`. The API Gateway validates the signature and checks the idempotency key — duplicate events within 24 hours return the cached workflow ID without spawning a second execution.

* **Step 2:** The Agentic PaaS API Gateway receives the webhook and maps the payload to the specific "L1 Triage Agent" manifest.

* **Step 3:** The Temporal Workflow Engine spins up the agent asynchronously, passing the alert payload as the initial context prompt.

* **Step 4:** The agent autonomously uses its skills to pull recent logs and check Kubernetes events.

* **Step 5:** Without any human initiation, the agent compiles a summary, updates the PagerDuty ticket, and posts its root-cause hypothesis to the SRE Slack channel.

### Journey 5: Tool Registration & Skill Composition (Persona: Skill Developer)

* **Step 1:** A platform engineer writes a new tool spec — a JSON schema defining the tool's name, typed inputs/outputs, required auth level (`read` vs `mutating`), and sandboxing requirements — and opens a Pull Request against the Tool Registry.

* **Step 2:** The platform's security team reviews the spec for threat surface (prompt injection risk, lateral movement potential) and approves it. The tool's status transitions from `pending_review` to `approved` and becomes visible in the Skill Builder.

* **Step 3:** A Skill Developer opens the **Agent Studio Skill Builder**, selects the approved tool, attaches one or more companion tools, and writes the governing System Operating Procedure (SOP) prompt that constrains when and how the tool is invoked.

* **Step 4:** The Skill Developer sets the RBAC classification (e.g., `mutating: true`, `approval_required: true`) and publishes the skill as `v1.0.0`. The skill immediately appears in the Skill Catalog for No-Code users.

* **Step 5:** No-Code users attaching the new skill see its version, description, and required approval level in the Catalog. Agents in production must pin to an explicit version (e.g., `db-triage-skill@v1.0.0`).

### Journey 6: Agent Team Handles a Multi-Domain Incident (Persona: SRE / Orchestrator)

* **Step 1:** A PagerDuty webhook fires an alert payload for a P1 production incident. The API Gateway validates the HMAC signature and checks the `Idempotency-Key` — the event is new, so the "Full-Stack Triage Team" manifest is invoked asynchronously.

* **Step 2:** The **Orchestrator Agent** (Tier 3 sub-agent acting as team lead) receives the alert payload, parses the affected services, and decomposes the investigation: it dispatches `DB Triage Sub-Agent` and `K8s Inspector Sub-Agent` **in parallel** via the Sub-Agent Registry.

* **Step 3:** Both sub-agents execute concurrently within their own durable Temporal workflows. The DB agent finds a slow query saturating the connection pool; the K8s agent finds an OOM-killed pod on the same node.

* **Step 4:** Both sub-agents return typed results to the Orchestrator. It synthesizes the findings, correlates the two root causes, and invokes the `Incident Report Skill` to generate a structured summary. The summary is posted to the SRE Slack channel.

* **Step 5:** The Orchestrator determines the K8s pod must be restarted. It invokes the `K8s Remediation Skill`, which triggers **HITL** because `restart_k8s_pod` is marked `mutating`. The entire team workflow suspends.

* **Step 6:** A Senior Engineer receives the alert, reviews the Execution Trace Visualizer (showing the parallel DB and K8s investigation lanes and the Orchestrator's synthesis), and clicks **Approve (MFA)**. The team resumes, the pod is restarted, and the Orchestrator closes the PagerDuty incident.

## 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

These requirements define the core capabilities of the platform, prioritized for an MVP to Production roadmap.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR1** | **P0** | **Agent Studio & Manifest Builder** | Provide an Agent Studio with five builder surfaces: Agent Builder (persona, skills, memory constraints, YAML export), Tool Registry UI (register and review tool specs), Skill Builder (compose tools + SOPs, publish versioned skills), Sub-Agent Registry (define capability contracts), and Team Manifest Editor (wire sub-agents with coordination strategy). Includes an AI-powered Manifest Assistant to guide no-code users through agent design. |
| **FR1a** | **P0** | **AI-Assisted Manifest Design (Manifest Assistant)** | Embed a conversational AI assistant within the Agent Creation UI. The assistant helps no-code users design agent manifests by: (1) drafting system prompts based on user description; (2) recommending appropriate skills from the active catalog; (3) proposing new skill/tool definitions when catalog gaps exist. The assistant has access to the live catalog of skills and tools (injected as context). Responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE), and users can apply suggestions directly to the form with one click. The assistant is itself a platform agent (reserved `tenant_id: "platform-system"`, running on a dedicated task queue) powered by a capable LLM. |
| **FR2** | **P0** | **Durable Execution Loop** | Agents and Agent Teams must execute within a resilient Temporal-backed loop. System failures, pod crashes, and API rate limits must not lose state — execution resumes exactly at the last committed step. Sub-agent failures within a team are retried independently; the team does not restart from the beginning. |
| **FR3** | **P0** | **Dynamic Tool Registry** | Support tool registration via MCP discovery or manual PR-based spec submission (typed JSON schema: inputs, outputs, auth level, sandboxing requirement). All tools require a security review approval gate before catalog availability. Tools are semantically versioned; breaking changes require a new major version. |
| **FR4** | **P0** | **Skill Catalog** | Senior Engineers compose approved Tools with System Operating Procedures (SOPs) into versioned, governed Skills. Skills use semver; production agent manifests must pin explicit versions. Deprecated skills display automated impact analysis (which agents are affected) and a migration path in Agent Studio. |
| **FR5** | **P1** | **Agent Simulator & Testing** | Agent Studio includes a Sandbox Simulator for both single agents and Agent Teams. In team mode, the telemetry panel shows sub-agent dispatch events (`[DISPATCH] → Sub-Agent`, `[RESULT] ← Sub-Agent`) and per-agent swimlanes in the live trace. Creators validate behavior before deploying to production. |
| **FR6** | **P1** | **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | When any agent or team member invokes a tool marked `mutating`, the entire workflow (including any running parallel sub-agents) enters a suspended state. An approval request is sent to the designated HITL Approver with full execution context. The workflow resumes only after MFA-backed approval or is terminated on rejection. |
| **FR7** | **P1** | **Universal Memory Access** | The platform manages short-term context windows (Redis) and long-term semantic memory (Vector DB via pgvector) automatically. Agent Teams share a configurable memory scope — members can read team-shared memories or operate in isolated per-agent memory partitions, configured in the Team Manifest. |
| **FR8** | **P1** | **Event-Driven Triggers** | The platform exposes webhook endpoints and event bus consumers (e.g., Kafka) for external systems to trigger agents or Agent Teams. Inbound webhooks require HMAC-SHA256 signature validation (`X-Signature` header) and an `Idempotency-Key`. Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff (up to 6 attempts) before routing to a dead-letter queue retained for 30 days. |
| **FR9** | **P1** | **Sub-Agent Invocation & Handoff** | Parent agents and orchestrators can invoke registered sub-agents sequentially (blocking) or in parallel (fan-out). Sub-agents return typed results against their declared capability contract. The platform enforces contract compliance at invocation time — out-of-scope skill usage is rejected and logged. |
| **FR10** | **P1** | **Execution Trace Visualizer** | Interactive DAG within Agent Studio showing reasoning steps, skill invocations, and Temporal history. In Agent Team mode, the DAG renders parallel sub-agent swimlanes with handoff edges, a unified timeline, and per-node cost and latency annotations. HITL-blocked nodes are highlighted for Approver action. |
| **FR11** | **P0** | **Enterprise SSO Integration** | Agent Studio supports Single Sign-On via SAML 2.0 or OIDC (e.g., Okta, Entra ID). Role assignments (Platform Admin, Skill Developer, Agent Creator, Sub-Agent Developer, HITL Approver) are sourced from the IdP via group claims at login time. |
| **FR12** | **P0** | **Granular RBAC & Personas** | The platform enforces Role-Based Access Control across all four tiers. Roles: Platform Admin (full access), Skill Developer (register tools, author skills), Sub-Agent Developer (define sub-agents and teams), Agent Creator (no-code agent and team assembly), and HITL Approver (approve/reject mutating actions). Each role is scoped to a tenant. |
| **FR13** | **P0** | **Sub-Agent Registry** | Platform provides a Sub-Agent Registry where Sub-Agent Developers define and version specialized sub-agents. Each entry specifies: `persona`, `allowed_skills` (version-pinned), `model`, `max_iterations`, and an invocation contract (typed input/output schema). Registered sub-agents are available to Team Manifests and parent agent reasoning loops. |
| **FR14** | **P1** | **Agent Team Orchestration** | Platform supports declarative Team Manifests specifying member sub-agents, coordination strategy (parallel fan-out, sequential chain, or conditional branching on sub-agent output), and shared memory scope. The orchestrator agent decomposes the goal, dispatches sub-agents, synthesizes results, and produces a unified response. Teams are simulated in the Agent Simulator before deployment. |
| **FR15** | **P1** | **Skill Command Interface & Hooks** | Skills are invocable via slash-command syntax (e.g., `/db-triage --target=prod-rds-01 --window=1h`) from the Agent Studio chat interface and the REST API. Arguments are validated against the skill's input schema before dispatch. The platform supports declarative pre/post-skill hooks (YAML-configured) for audit logging, cost metering, and HITL interception — without modifying skill logic. |
| **FR16** | **P1** | **Capability Lifecycle Management** | All four tiers follow a formal state machine: `Draft → Staged → Active ↔ Paused → Archived`. State transitions are immutably logged. Deployment supports three strategies: All-at-once, Blue-Green, and Canary (10% → 25% → 100% with configurable ramp). Auto-rollback triggers if workflow success rate drops more than 10% from the prior version's baseline over 10 minutes. |
| **FR17** | **P1** | **Cost & Quota Dashboard** | Real-time cost attribution at tenant, agent, and skill granularity: LLM inference tokens, sandbox execution time, and Vector DB operations. Budget alerts fire at 80% and 100% of the monthly allocation. Soft quota limits queue requests (returning `Retry-After`); hard limits reject with `429 QuotaExceeded`. Quota thresholds are configurable per tenant via Agent Studio settings. | 

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

These requirements dictate the operational, security, and resiliency standards (The "SRE" Layer).

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **NFR1** | **P0** | **Execution Sandboxing** | Tool execution involving arbitrary code or unknown inputs must run in ephemeral, isolated Docker containers. Containers prevent network lateral movement and are destroyed immediately after execution. Sandboxing applies to all four tiers — a skill invoking a tool always goes through the sandbox boundary. |
| **NFR2** | **P0** | **Immutable Auditability** | Every LLM prompt, skill decision, tool invocation, and sub-agent dispatch must be recorded via OpenTelemetry and stored in an immutable ledger. Agent Team traces must render as a unified DAG with per-sub-agent swimlanes; every span includes: skill invoked, tokens consumed, latency, and outcome. Ledger must support SRE replay and compliance export. |
| **NFR3** | **P0** | **Fault Tolerance** | The orchestration layer must survive pod crashes, node terminations, and API rate limits without losing session state. Within an Agent Team, sub-agent failures must be retried independently (up to the configured retry limit) — a single sub-agent failure must not terminate the full team. The orchestrator surfaces a partial result if a sub-agent exhausts retries. |
| **NFR4** | **P1** | **High Concurrency** | The platform must support thousands of simultaneous agent and team workflows via asynchronous, non-blocking Temporal workers on Kubernetes. Worker replicas scale horizontally based on Temporal task-queue depth. Agent Teams with parallel sub-agents must not serialize execution — each sub-agent occupies an independent worker. |
| **NFR5** | **P1** | **Model Agnosticism** | The LLM provider is pluggable across the platform (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, local vLLM/Ollama). Model selection is configurable per-sub-agent — members of the same Agent Team can run different models. Provider switching must not require manifest changes beyond updating the `model` field. |
| **NFR6** | **P1** | **Cost & Token Governance** | Cost governance operates at tenant, agent, skill, and tool-call granularity (LLM tokens + sandbox execution time + Vector DB ops). Soft quota limits queue excess requests and return a `Retry-After` header. Hard limits terminate the workflow with `429 QuotaExceeded`. Infinite ReAct loops are automatically terminated at a configurable `max_iterations` ceiling (default 10 per sub-agent). |
| **NFR7** | **P0** | **Agent Machine Identities** | Every agent, sub-agent, and team member operates using a short-lived, scoped OIDC token (5-minute TTL) issued by an internal STS service. Tokens contain the agent ID, permitted skill list, and resource constraints. Static or shared API keys are disallowed. The Tool Router validates token scope before any tool execution; out-of-scope invocations are rejected and logged. |
| **NFR8** | **P0** | **Zero-Trust Networking** | All inter-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with certificates rotated every 30 days. Kubernetes NetworkPolicy restricts Agent Worker pod egress exclusively to the LLM Gateway and Temporal cluster — no direct internet access. Service-to-service calls are authenticated via short-lived OIDC tokens in addition to mTLS. |
| **NFR9** | **P0** | **Webhook Security** | All inbound webhook events must include an HMAC-SHA256 signature (`X-Signature` header) computed over the request body with a tenant-specific secret. Requests missing a valid signature or carrying an `X-Timestamp` older than 5 minutes are rejected (replay prevention). An `Idempotency-Key` is required; duplicate events within 24 hours return the cached workflow response. |
| **NFR10** | **P0** | **Secret Lifecycle Management** | LLM API keys, OIDC signing keys, and database credentials rotate automatically on configurable intervals (default 90 days). A leak-detection service continuously scans execution logs and audit trails for credential exposure. Detected leaks trigger automatic revocation and an on-call alert within 5 minutes. |
| **NFR11** | **P1** | **Multi-Tenancy Isolation** | All platform resources — agent manifests, tool registrations, skill definitions, sub-agent contracts, team manifests, execution traces, and vector memories — are strictly isolated per tenant via separate PostgreSQL schemas and row-level security. A runaway workflow or quota breach in one tenant cannot consume resources allocated to another tenant. |
| **NFR12** | **P1** | **SLA & Availability** | The platform targets 99.95% availability for the API Gateway and Agent Studio. Performance SLOs: p99 workflow invocation latency ≤ 2s; p95 tool execution latency ≤ 5s. Disaster recovery targets: RTO ≤ 1 hour, RPO ≤ 15 minutes. Sustained SLO breaches trigger automated escalation and disable non-critical background processing. |
| **NFR13** | **P1** | **Session & Memory Lifecycle** | Sessions carry a configurable hard timeout (default 24h) and idle timeout (default 1h). Each session enforces a memory budget (default 512MB): purge policy activates at 80% utilization; workflow terminates with a structured `OutOfMemory` error at 100%. Vector embeddings are retained for a configurable duration per tenant (default 90 days) and then archived to cold storage. |

### 5.2 Agent Simulator & Chat
A two-column layout for testing agents and Agent Teams before deployment. A mode toggle switches between single-agent and team simulation views.
- **Left Column (Chat UI)**: Standard chat interface. In team mode, the agent label shows which sub-agent responded (e.g., `[Orchestrator]`, `[DB Triage]`).
- **Right Column (Live Telemetry)**: Real-time scrolling console with expandable JSON payloads. In team mode, sub-agent dispatches and results appear as indented swimlane entries.
- **Status Bar**: Shows current active agent/sub-agent and its state (REASONING / DISPATCHING / AWAITING_HITL).

### 5.3 Execution Trace Visualizer
A full-screen analytical dashboard for SREs and Approvers. In Agent Team mode, the canvas renders parallel sub-agent swimlanes with handoff edges; clicking any node opens the approval or inspection drawer.
- **Header**: Workflow ID | Team / Agent name | Status badge (`RUNNING` / `PAUSED - HITL` / `COMPLETE`)
- **Main Canvas**: Interactive DAG. Single-agent mode shows a linear chain; Team mode shows swimlanes — one per sub-agent — with fork/join edges from the Orchestrator. Each node shows latency and token cost on hover.
- **Side Panel**: Clicking a HITL-blocked node shows the justification, evidence summary, and action buttons. Clicking any other node shows its full OTel span payload.

## 6. Extended Platform Vision

This section captures the next-generation vision for the Agentic PaaS, expanding from single-agent workflows toward a self-assembling, multi-agent workforce. It is intentionally written as a narrative vision layer — formal FR/NFR decomposition follows in a subsequent iteration.

---

### 6.1 Platform Extensibility Model

The platform adopts a four-tier capability hierarchy that governs how capabilities are built, composed, and orchestrated. Each tier is independently governed, versioned, and RBAC-controlled.

**Tier 1 — Tools (Primitive Atoms)**
- Primitive, stateless, single-purpose operations registered in the Tool Registry (e.g., `query_db`, `restart_pod`, `fetch_logs`, `send_slack`, `execute_code`).
- Each tool exposes a typed JSON schema: inputs, outputs, auth requirements, and sandboxing level.
- Any platform engineer can register a new tool via a PR-reviewed tool spec; tools undergo security review before catalog availability.
- Tools are semantically versioned (semver); breaking changes require a new major version and migration path.

**Tier 2 — Skills (Governed Compositions)**
- Skills bundle one or more Tools with a structured System Operating Procedure (SOP) and RBAC guardrails.
- A skill encapsulates the *how* — the agent knows *what* skill to invoke; the skill knows which tools to call and in what order.
- A Skill Developer writes, reviews, and versions skills; No-Code users attach skills to agents without needing to understand underlying tool mechanics.
- Skills are independently versioned; production agent manifests must pin to explicit skill versions.

**Tier 3 — Sub-Agents (Specialized Executors)**
- Sub-agents are purpose-built agents with a constrained tool/skill scope, defined `persona`, `allowed_skills`, `model`, and `max_iterations`.
- Each sub-agent has a declared capability contract registered in a Sub-Agent Registry.
- A parent agent can invoke sub-agents mid-reasoning for specialized tasks (e.g., invoking a `DB Triage Sub-Agent` to analyze slow query logs while the parent continues broader investigation).
- Invocation modes: **sequential** (parent blocks awaiting result) or **parallel** (parent fans out to multiple sub-agents simultaneously, collecting all results before synthesis).

**Tier 4 — Agent Teams (Collaborative Pipelines)**
- Agent Teams are declaratively defined groups of specialized sub-agents that collaborate to decompose and solve a complex task.
- The orchestrator agent breaks the user's goal into sub-tasks, dispatches each to the appropriate specialist sub-agent (parallelizing where possible), and synthesizes their outputs into a unified response.
- Teams support: parallel fan-out, sequential chains, and conditional branching (sub-agent A's output determines which sub-agent runs next).
- Each team is defined by a **Team Manifest**: team name, member sub-agents, coordination strategy (parallel/sequential/conditional), and shared memory scope.

---

### 6.2 Command & Dispatch Architecture

The platform exposes a unified command interface for invoking skills.

- **Skill Command Interface**: Skills are invocable via slash-command syntax (e.g., `/db-triage`, `/k8s-remediate`) within the Agent Studio chat and via REST API.
- Skills accept typed, named arguments (e.g., `/db-triage --target=prod-rds-01 --window=1h`), validated against the skill's input schema before dispatch.
- The agent's LLM reasoning loop emits skill invocations as structured tool calls; the platform's **Skill Dispatcher** translates these into skill + argument payloads and routes them through the Execution Plane.
- **Hooks**: The platform supports declarative pre/post-skill hooks for cross-cutting concerns — audit logging, cost metering, HITL interception, rate limit enforcement — without modifying skill logic.
- **Routing**: The Tool Router evaluates RBAC, quota availability, and sandboxing requirements before dispatching any tool chain. A failed pre-dispatch check returns a structured rejection with reason code, not a silent failure.

---

### 6.2a Platform System Agents (Manifest Assistant)

The platform reserves a special tenant (`tenant_id: "platform-system"`) for deploying system agents that enhance the user experience without requiring code.

**Manifest Assistant Agent**
The first platform system agent is the **Manifest Assistant**, embedded in the Agent Creation UI. It helps no-code users design agent manifests conversationally:

1. **Catalog Awareness via Context Injection**: When a user opens the Agent Creation dialog, the frontend fetches the live catalog (active skills + approved tools) and injects it as a structured `<catalog>` XML block prepended to the user's first message. The Manifest Assistant parses this block and uses it to ground recommendations.

2. **Threefold Assistance**:
   - **System Prompt Drafting**: Based on user description, the assistant drafts a natural, persona-driven system prompt starting with "You are..." and incorporating domain constraints.
   - **Skill Recommendation**: The assistant recommends specific skills from the catalog (by exact name and version), with explanations of why each skill is appropriate.
   - **New Skill Proposals**: When the catalog lacks a capability, the assistant proposes a new skill manifest (name, description, input/output schema, mutating flag) — a "skill to create" section that the user can export and hand to a Skill Developer.

3. **Real-Time SSE Streaming**: The assistant's responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events, showing thinking blocks, tool calls (e.g., code execution for analyzing routing logic), and final recommendations as they're computed.

4. **One-Click Apply**: Users see a preview of the assistant's recommendations (system prompt, skills list) and click "Apply to Form" to auto-populate the Agent Creation form fields — no copy-paste required.

5. **Isolated Execution**: The Manifest Assistant runs on its own Temporal task queue (`platform-system-agent-queue`) with a second Agent Worker instance, ensuring no interference with user agent workflows.

**V2 Roadmap**: Extend platform system agents to include:
- **Skill Designer Assistant**: Helps Skill Developers compose tools and write SOPs interactively
- **Incident Runbook Generator**: Analyzes agent failure logs and auto-generates runbooks and alerts
- **Cost Optimizer**: Recommends skill/model/sampling strategy trade-offs to reduce tenant costs

---

### 6.3 Security Framework Vision

The platform treats security as a first-class platform concern, not an operational afterthought. Every new capability introduced must clear a defined security bar before reaching production.

**Threat Model**
The platform maintains a living threat model (STRIDE methodology) covering: agent prompt injection via crafted user inputs, tool code injection through skill parameters, cross-tenant data exfiltration via shared infrastructure, and LLM API key exfiltration through execution trace leakage. Every tool and skill registered to the catalog must include a documented threat surface as part of its spec.

**Zero-Trust Networking**
All inter-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with certificates rotated every 30 days. Agent Worker pods operate under strict Kubernetes NetworkPolicy: egress is permitted only to the LLM Gateway and Temporal cluster — no direct internet access. Agent machine identities are short-lived OIDC tokens (5-minute TTL), scoped to specific skill invocations and containing explicit resource constraints.

**Webhook Security**
All inbound webhook events must carry an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Signature` header, computed over the request body using a tenant-specific secret. The platform rejects requests missing a valid signature or carrying a timestamp older than 5 minutes (replay prevention). Every webhook-triggered agent invocation requires an `Idempotency-Key` header; duplicate invocations within 24 hours return the cached result without spawning a new workflow.

**Secret Lifecycle**
LLM API keys, OIDC signing keys, and database credentials rotate automatically on configurable intervals (default: 90 days). A secret-leak detection service continuously scans execution logs and audit trails for accidental credential exposure; detected leaks trigger automatic revocation and on-call alert within 5 minutes.

---

### 6.4 Platform Lifecycle Vision

The platform manages the full lifecycle of tools, skills, and agent manifests — from creation through deprecation — with explicit governance at each stage.

**Skill Versioning & Deprecation**
Skills use semantic versioning. Breaking changes require a new major version; non-breaking additions increment the minor version. When a skill is deprecated, Agent Studio highlights affected agents and provides a migration guide. Automated impact analysis surfaces which agents pin to the deprecated version. Agents in production must reference explicit skill versions — wildcard or `latest` references are disallowed.

**Agent Manifest Lifecycle**
Agent manifests follow a formal state machine: `Draft → Staged → Active ↔ Paused → Archived`. Every state transition is immutably logged with actor identity, timestamp, and justification. Staged agents are automatically exercised through the Agent Simulator (sanity-check workflow) before a human approver promotes them to Active. Archived manifests are retained for audit and rollback purposes.

**Safe Deployment Strategies**
Agent manifests support three rollout strategies: **All-at-once** (immediate full traffic switch), **Blue-Green** (dual deployment with instant traffic switch-over), and **Canary** (10% → 25% → 100% over a configurable ramp window). All deployments include pre-flight checks: skill version availability, model compatibility, RBAC validation. If workflow success rate drops more than 10% below the prior version's baseline for 10 consecutive minutes, the platform auto-rolls back and pages the deploying team.

**Rollback & Version History**
The platform retains a complete version history for all agent manifests and skills. A single-click rollback is available from Agent Studio for any active or recently deprecated version. All rollbacks are audited — execution history from the rolled-forward version is preserved; no data is lost on rollback.

---

### 6.5 Enterprise Reliability Vision

The platform is designed to meet enterprise-grade reliability commitments across multi-tenancy, availability, and recovery.

**Multi-Tenancy**
The platform enforces strict tenant isolation at the data layer: separate PostgreSQL schemas and row-level security per tenant. Agent manifests, execution traces, long-term memories, and tool registrations are tenant-scoped and invisible across tenant boundaries. A failure or runaway workflow in Tenant A cannot consume resources allocated to Tenant B. Each tenant receives configurable resource quotas (concurrent workflows, token budget, sandbox containers).

**SLA Commitments**
The platform targets 99.95% availability for the API Gateway and Agent Studio. p99 workflow invocation latency ≤ 2s; p95 tool execution latency ≤ 5s. These commitments are enforced via SLO burn rate alerts; any sustained SLO breach pauses non-critical background work and escalates to on-call.

**Session & Memory Lifecycle**
Sessions carry a configurable hard timeout (default 24h) and idle timeout (default 1h). On expiry, short-term context cache (Redis) is cleared immediately. Long-term memory (vector embeddings) is retained for a configurable duration per tenant (default 90 days) before archival to cold storage. Each session enforces a memory budget (default 512MB); a purge policy activates at 80% utilization and terminates the workflow at 100% with a structured `OutOfMemory` error.

**Disaster Recovery**
Daily encrypted backups of PostgreSQL, Vector DB, and agent manifests are retained for 90 days. Cross-region failover targets RTO ≤ 1 hour and RPO ≤ 15 minutes for all stateful services. Failover procedures are tested quarterly without requiring manual operator intervention.

---

### 6.6 Operational Excellence Vision

The platform bakes operational rigor into its design: every component emits structured telemetry, every failure class has a runbook, and every cost is attributed and governed.

**SLO Framework**
Platform-wide SLOs: agent workflow success rate ≥ 99.5%; tool execution success rate ≥ 99%; p99 ReAct loop iteration latency ≤ 3s. Error budget burn rate is tracked continuously; SLO breach triggers automated escalation and disables non-critical feature flags. Per-skill and per-agent SLO dashboards give team owners visibility into their contribution to platform health.

**Observability Stack**
Pre-built Grafana dashboards track: per-skill success/failure rates; LLM provider cost and latency breakdown; Temporal workflow queue depth and throughput; sandbox container spawn/destroy lifecycle; per-tenant resource utilization. Every ReAct loop iteration emits an OTel span carrying: skill invoked, tokens consumed, latency, and outcome. Agent Team execution traces render as a unified DAG showing parallel sub-agent timelines, handoff points, and synthesis steps.

**Incident Response**
Tier-1 runbooks are defined for: Temporal worker crash, LLM provider outage, webhook queue backlog exceeding threshold, and Vector DB p99 latency spike. Each runbook specifies detection criteria (Prometheus alert), diagnostic queries (trace IDs, log patterns), mitigation steps (circuit breaker, provider failover), and escalation contacts. Runbooks are versioned alongside the platform codebase.

**Cost Governance**
Every platform action is costed and attributed at multiple granularities: per-tenant (monthly billing), per-agent (ROI tracking), and per-skill (value analysis). Cost components include: LLM inference tokens, sandbox container execution time, Vector DB read/write operations, and data transfer. Tenants receive monthly cost reports with a next-month forecast. Budget alerts fire at 80% and 100% of monthly allocation. Quota enforcement operates at tenant, agent, and skill levels: soft limits queue requests (returning a `Retry-After` header); hard limits reject with `429 QuotaExceeded`.

---

## 7. Platform Administration & Governance

This section captures the administrative and governance capabilities required to operate the Agentic PaaS in a multi-tenant, production-grade environment. Platform Admins require dedicated tooling to manage tenants, configure LLM providers, track costs, audit platform actions, and manage platform system agents.

### 7.1 Admin API Requirements

The Admin API (`services/admin-api`, port 8089) is a dedicated backend service that aggregates platform-wide data and actions under strong authorization control.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR-ADMIN-1** | **P0** | **Admin API Auth & Key Management** | All Admin API endpoints (except `/health`) require `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>` header validation. Admin API keys are long-lived, platform-wide secrets stored in environment and rotated quarterly. Invalid or missing keys return `401 Unauthorized`. Rate limiting is enforced at 1000 req/min per admin key. |
| **FR-ADMIN-2** | **P0** | **Tenant CRUD Operations** | Admin API exposes: `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants` (list all with metadata), `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants` (create new tenant with default quotas), `GET /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id` (fetch single tenant including agent/skill/tool counts), `PUT /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id/quota` (update max concurrent workflows and monthly token budget), `PUT /api/v1/admin/tenants/:id/status` (activate/suspend/archive tenant). Suspended tenants return `403 Forbidden` for all workflow initiations. |
| **FR-ADMIN-3** | **P1** | **Tenant Quota Enforcement** | API Gateway enforces tenant-scoped quotas: `max_concurrent_workflows` (returns `429 TooManyWorkflows` if exceeded), `token_budget_monthly` (soft limit queues requests with `Retry-After`; hard limit at 105% returns `429 QuotaExceeded`). Quota consumption is tracked in real-time via `cost_events` table and reported per tenant on dashboards. |
| **FR-ADMIN-4** | **P0** | **LLM Configuration & Provider Management** | Admin API proxies LLM provider configuration: `GET /api/v1/admin/llm/config` (returns current proxy URL, mode, API keys), `PUT /api/v1/admin/llm/config` (updates LLM Gateway config and persists to `platform_config` table for restart durability). Supports modes: `mock`, `anthropic`, `openai`, and `custom`. Config changes take effect immediately via hot-reload; no service restart required. |
| **FR-ADMIN-5** | **P1** | **Per-Tenant Model Access Control** | Admin API manages per-tenant LLM model allowlists: `GET /api/v1/admin/llm/access` (list all models and per-tenant access), `PUT /api/v1/admin/llm/access/:tenant_id` (enable/disable specific models, optionally set per-model daily token limits). If a model is disabled globally, no tenant can use it. If a model is disabled for a specific tenant, that tenant's workflows are rejected at model selection time with clear reason code. |
| **FR-ADMIN-6** | **P1** | **System Agent Management** | Admin API manages platform system agents (agents under reserved `tenant_id: "platform-system"`): `GET /api/v1/admin/system-agents` (list all system agents), `GET /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id` (fetch single system agent manifest), `PUT /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id` (update manifest: system_prompt, model, skills, max_iterations), `POST /api/v1/admin/system-agents/:id/transition` (lifecycle transitions: draft → staged → active). |
| **FR-ADMIN-7** | **P1** | **Cross-Tenant Execution Visibility** | Admin API queries Temporal and `execution_events` table to provide cross-tenant execution traces: `GET /api/v1/admin/executions` (query recent sessions across all tenants with filters: tenant, agent_id, status, date_range), `GET /api/v1/admin/executions/:id` (fetch single execution trace with full DAG and event stream). Sessions for different tenants are visible to admins but never leaked cross-tenant to user APIs. |
| **FR-ADMIN-8** | **P1** | **Cost Aggregation & Reporting** | Admin API aggregates costs from `cost_events` table: `GET /api/v1/admin/cost` (platform-wide cost, queryable by period and tenant), `GET /api/v1/admin/cost/:tenant_id` (per-tenant breakdown: agent, skill, model, tokens in/out, sandbox ms, estimated cost). Costs are computed using configurable rate tables per model and region. |
| **FR-ADMIN-9** | **P1** | **Immutable Audit Log Queries** | Admin API exposes `GET /api/v1/admin/audit` (query immutable `lifecycle_events` table across all tenants and resources). Supports filtering: resource_type (agent/skill/tool/sub_agent/team), tenant_id, from_state, to_state, actor, date_range. Returns paginated results (50 per page). Audit logs are write-only from the platform; no administrative edits or deletions. |

### 7.2 Admin Console UI Requirements

The Admin Console (`apps/admin-console`, port 3001) is a Next.js web application providing graphical administration interfaces for platform operators. It requires strong authentication and operates independently from the Agent Studio.

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FR-ADMIN-10** | **P0** | **Admin Console Authentication** | Dedicated login page at `/login` accepts admin API key (stored in `sessionStorage` after successful verification via `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/verify`). Auth tokens are validated on every page load; expired or missing keys redirect to login. Default admin key for local dev: `dev-admin-key`. No SSO required for V1 (V2 roadmap includes OIDC federation). |
| **FR-ADMIN-11** | **P0** | **Admin Dashboard** | Landing page after login shows: (1) Summary cards: active tenants count, active workflows count, LLM mode badge, service health status (ping all backends), (2) Recent executions table (last 10 sessions across all tenants, filterable by status), (3) Platform cost this month (aggregated), (4) Quick links to tenant management, LLM config, system agents. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. |
| **FR-ADMIN-12** | **P0** | **Tenant Management UI** | Full CRUD interface at `/tenants`: (1) Tenants table: tenant_id, display_name, status badge (active/suspended), agent_count, skill_count, max_concurrent_workflows, monthly_token_budget, actions (View detail, Suspend/Activate), (2) Create Tenant button opens modal with fields: tenant_id, display_name, max_concurrent_workflows (default 50), monthly_token_budget (default 10M), (3) View tenant detail page at `/tenants/[id]` with editable quota settings and links to agents/cost/audit filtered by tenant. |
| **FR-ADMIN-13** | **P1** | **LLM Configuration UI** | Page at `/llm-config` with two sections: (1) **Platform LLM Configuration**: mode selector (Mock / Anthropic / OpenAI / Custom), base URL input, API key input (masked with show/hide toggle), Save button persists to Admin API. Shows current mode badge and status. (2) **Model Access Control**: table listing all available models with global enabled status and per-tenant access counts. Clicking "Manage Access" opens a drawer with per-tenant toggles and optional daily token limits. |
| **FR-ADMIN-14** | **P1** | **System Agent Manager UI** | Page at `/system-agents` showing: (1) List of platform system agents (agents under `tenant_id: "platform-system"`) with name, status badge (active/staged/draft), model, version, last deployed timestamp. (2) Detail panel on the right showing selected agent's manifest (as JSON or YAML), edit button opens modal with textarea for manifest editing, Deploy button transitions draft → staged → active. (3) Manifest Assistant prominently featured as a special system agent with ability to edit its system prompt and view its capabilities. |
| **FR-ADMIN-15** | **P1** | **Execution Trace Visualizer (Admin)** | Page at `/executions` with cross-tenant visibility: (1) Tenant tabs at top for quick filtering, (2) Filter bar: status (RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED/ALL), agent_id search, date_range, (3) Results table: session_id, tenant, agent_id, status badge, started_time, duration, event_count, (4) Click row to open `/executions/[id]` with full trace DAG and event timeline (same as Agent Studio, but admin view). Live trace polling for RUNNING executions. |
| **FR-ADMIN-16** | **P1** | **Cost Tracking UI** | Page at `/cost` providing: (1) Period selector (7d, 30d, 90d, custom), (2) Summary cards: total tokens (platform-wide), estimated cost, most expensive tenant, top model used, (3) Tenant breakdown bar chart (input/output tokens per tenant), (4) Detailed breakdown table showing: tenant, agent, skill, model, tokens_in, tokens_out, sandbox_ms, estimated_cost, with per-tenant subtotals. Export CSV button. Drill-down links to `/cost?tenant_id=X`. |
| **FR-ADMIN-17** | **P1** | **Audit Log Viewer UI** | Page at `/audit` displaying: (1) Filter bar: resource_type (agent/skill/tool/sub_agent/team) dropdown, tenant dropdown, date range, (2) Audit events table (paginated, 50 per page): timestamp, tenant, resource (type + ID), state_change (from → to), actor, actions (expand to view full details). Click row to open modal showing full event payload: timestamp, actor, tenant, resource, old_state, new_state, metadata. Export CSV button. |

### 7.3 Admin-Specific Non-Functional Requirements

| **ID** | **Priority** | **Requirement** | **Description** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **NFR-ADMIN-1** | **P0** | **Admin API Rate Limiting & DoS Protection** | Admin API enforces per-key rate limits: 1000 req/min per admin key, 10000 req/min aggregate. Excess requests return `429 TooManyRequests`. DDoS protection via IP-based circuit breaker: if a single IP exceeds 10k req/min, all traffic from that IP is blocked for 5 minutes. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-2** | **P0** | **Admin Session Security** | Admin Console sessions stored in `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) for automatic clearing on browser close. No persistent cookies. Session tokens are included in every Admin API request. Idle timeout: 30 minutes (session expires and redirects to login). All admin actions are logged in `admin_audit_log` table with actor identity and timestamp. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-3** | **P0** | **Admin API Authentication & Authorization** | All Admin API endpoints (except `/health`) validate bearer token. Token must be an admin key or OIDC token with `platform:admin` role claim (V2). Invalid tokens return `401 Unauthorized`. MFA (multi-factor authentication) required for sensitive actions: model access changes, tenant suspension/deletion, LLM config changes, system agent deployment (V2 roadmap). |
| **NFR-ADMIN-4** | **P1** | **Admin Console Network Isolation** | Admin Console optionally runs on a separate hostname (e.g., `admin.platform.local`) or behind VPN. CORS is strictly limited: Admin Console can only talk to Admin API. Admin API never serves agent-facing endpoints. Cross-admin-console API communication is blocked (no browser JavaScript can call Agent API from Admin Console). |
| **NFR-ADMIN-5** | **P1** | **Audit Trail Immutability** | All admin actions (tenant CRUD, LLM config changes, system agent updates) are recorded in an immutable `admin_audit_log` table with columns: id (PK), timestamp, actor, action, resource_type, resource_id, old_value, new_value, ip_address, user_agent. Admins cannot edit or delete audit log entries. Audit log exports are cryptographically signed. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-6** | **P1** | **Admin API Observability** | All Admin API endpoints emit OTel spans with: endpoint, actor (from token), tenant (if applicable), status_code, latency_ms, bytes_in, bytes_out. Admin-specific dashboards in Prometheus/Grafana track: admin API throughput, error rates, top admins by request count, slow queries, authentication failures. |
| **NFR-ADMIN-7** | **P1** | **Consistent Data Across Admin Operations** | Admin API guarantees atomic tenant CRUD: create tenant updates `tenant_settings`, sets default quotas, and logs audit event in a single transaction. Reads of tenants, costs, and execution traces are eventually consistent (reads from replica DBs permissible). Critical writes use strong consistency. |

### 7.4 V2 Roadmap: Advanced Admin Features

The following capabilities are planned for V2 (Post-MVP) and represent extensions to core admin governance:

| **Feature** | **Rationale** | **Estimated Effort** |
|---|---|---|
| **OIDC Admin Federation** | Single sign-on for admins via Okta/Entra ID with role-based JWT claims (e.g., `platform:admin`, `platform:readonly-observer`). Moves away from static API keys. | 3 sprints |
| **MFA for Sensitive Actions** | High-risk admin operations (LLM config change, tenant suspension, system agent deploy) require TOTP or hardware security key. Reduces insider risk. | 2 sprints |
| **Temporal Task Queue Monitor** | Admin UI shows Temporal queue depth per tenant, alerts on queue backlog exceeding threshold, links to Temporal UI for deep inspection. | 2 sprints |
| **Tool Security Review Queue** | Tools submitted as `pending_review` appear in admin dashboard; admin approves/rejects before tool becomes `approved` and visible to users. | 2 sprints |
| **HITL Approval Dashboard** | Admin UI shows all HITL-suspended workflows platform-wide with evidence and approval buttons. Approver clicks Approve/Reject with MFA. Integrates with PagerDuty for escalation. | 3 sprints |
| **Data Retention & Archival Policies** | Per-tenant settings: how long to retain vector embeddings, execution traces, audit logs before archiving to S3. Auto-enforcement via background jobs. | 2 sprints |
| **Model Quota Alerts** | Set alert thresholds per tenant (e.g., fire Slack message when token budget reaches 80% consumed). Webhook triggers to external monitoring. | 1 sprint |
| **Admin Activity Log with Export** | Admin audit log with rich filtering and CSV/JSON export for compliance audits (SOC2, ISO27001). | 1 sprint |
| **Tenant Provisioning Automation** | Terraform/Pulumi modules to auto-provision tenants with RLS policies, Temporal queues, cost tracking views, audit log tables. | 2 sprints |
| **Cost Forecasting & Anomaly Detection** | ML-backed predictions of next month's tenant costs; alerts if tenant's consumption suddenly spikes (potential runaway workflow). | 3 sprints |
